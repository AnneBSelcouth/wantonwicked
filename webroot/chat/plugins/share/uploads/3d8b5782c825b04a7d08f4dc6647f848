Hannah Dalton,,"vtr.png|#000000|12px|verdana|Dark and somewhat off the radar, normal folk know better than to step foot in a bar like this. It wasnÂ´t claimed by any particular faction, seeing a somewhat eclectic crowd of law-ignoring citizens. This was the sort of place where people like Hannah Dalton managed to fit right in, and indeed, she was sitting in a booth at the far end of the bar, a couple of dudes sitting there with her. Looks like they were discussing business of some sort. She was dressed for the place, attire that allowed her to move well but still offered protection and perfectly in-tune with mortal street-fashion. She was also visibly armed with at least one gun, but that wasnÂ´t too unusual for the bar.||0"
Madison Gray,,"vtr.png|#000000|12px|verdana|Madison walked in and decided to ditch the gang colors going into who knows what turf. Wearing just a black unzipped sweatshirt with the hood up. Her tinted glasses on her face covering those blood red dead eyes of hers as that pale shine shined dimply under the fluorescent lighting of the dodgy bar.  She&amp;#39;d reach into the pockets of those tan cargo pants she was wearing and pulled out a piece of gun taking a moment to look around and ignore various cat calls and comments as she started to walk over towards Hannah and the group with her.&amp;#34;Sup Hannah, I like your part of town.&amp;#34;She said with a playful grin as she waited for the woman to turn.||0"
Hannah Dalton,,"vtr.png|#000000|12px|verdana|She didnÂ´t actually turn, for a moment it seemed like she was just going to ignore Madison as she kept talking to her company, but it soon became clear she was wrapping things up. Â´Right, you boys take off then. I got other business to take care of.Â´ and so they did, taking off and leaving Hannah sitting by herself. She still didnÂ´t turn, apparently waiting for Madison to sit across from her.||0"
Madison Gray,,"vtr.png|#000000|12px|verdana|That hood still up she took off her glasses after sitting down. Putting her elbows on the table and resting her chin in her hands as she gave Hannah a playful smile. A bit of that pink hair falling in her face.&amp;#34;So people talk as they do and I thought it might be good for us to have a little chat, ya know? I&amp;#39;d hate to give you the wrong idea about what..Well I guess I don&amp;#39;t exactly know what you heard Hannah.&amp;#34;She said grasping a tooth pick and then flipping it between her fingers idley shifting the weight of her head to just one hand as the haunt tilted her head slightly looking at her.||0"
Hannah Dalton,,vtr.png|#000000|12px|verdana|&amp;#96;WouldnÂ´t want me to think youÂ´re here to put a few bullets in me or anything? WhatÂ´re you packing anyway?&amp;#96;||0
Madison Gray,,"vtr.png|#000000|12px|verdana|&amp;#34;Nothing I can show off in a room full of blood sacks. But don&amp;#39;t worry, on my honor as a knight I&amp;#39;m not her to fuck you up, girl.&amp;#34;She said with a little wink.&amp;#34;While that may not mean anything to you, trust me there&amp;#39;s a whole gang of people that&amp;#39;d ruin my day if I threw around those kinda words frivolously. No this visit is purely friendly.&amp;#34;||0"
Hannah Dalton,,"vtr.png|#000000|12px|verdana|&amp;#96;Shit,&amp;#96; she says, pulling out her own gun and placing it on the table with one hand still gripping it, &amp;#96;this is Georgia bitch, if you canÂ´t show Â´em here you canÂ´t show em anywhere. Me, IÂ´m a smith and wesson girl, classic 1911, E-series. May not do the job as well as a fucking claymore or whatever youÂ´ve got going there, but it still stings.&amp;#96; She leaned back, hand still on the gun and an expression to suggest she might squeeze the trigger at any time. Â´You got your car yet? Now that is some weird shit, sister. Get contracted to fuck me up, get pulled off the case and challenging your employer to a duel, then backing the fuck down in the old house and getting a car for it. WhatÂ´s up with that?&amp;#96; ||0"
Madison Gray,,"vtr.png|#000000|12px|verdana|&amp;#34;Its a game, Hannah. You&amp;#39;re a hustler yourself you gotta get it. This ones just much older and with far more stuck up corpses than you&amp;#39;re used to dealing with. Given that his stupid ass intentions leaked I thought I should tell you what went wont..You rustled the horny bitches feathers and he wanted me to...Get this..Slap you, hard.&amp;#34;She said with a little laugh.&amp;#34;Oh and to tell you the full power of the Invictus would fall upon you. Both of which are stupid as fuck by the way. Then he tries to cancel on me and not only that. He doesn&amp;#39;t pay and threatens me..I thought you might like to know how much you got under his skin..I hate to have someone thinking I&amp;#39;m her enemy when I&amp;#39;m not. So thats why my ass is in this seat.&amp;#34;||0"

Madison Gray,,"vtr.png|#000000|12px|verdana|&amp;#34;I know, and I made that clear to the entire community as you saw that I would slaughter him. You&amp;#39;re a smart woman Hannah. Why don&amp;#39;t you tell me?&amp;#34;She said with a curious glance at the Carthian.||0"
Madison Gray,Alice Stepford,vtr.png|#000000|12px|verdana|Ended up thralling her?||0
Hannah Dalton,,"vtr.png|#000000|12px|verdana|&amp;#96;Either because youÂ´re a punk-ass little bitch, or to make fun of him. Or maybe this is all a conspiracy to get me resting easy then bam, iced in my sleep. That last one would really make the unconquered into a bunch of petty tards, though.Â´||0"
Madison Gray,,"vtr.png|#000000|12px|verdana|She laughed a little bit.&amp;#34;This was all petty as fuck, a Baron doesn&amp;#39;t have any place responding to your insults..But he did. This isn&amp;#39;t about him anymore. Its about me, I came here to thank you actually. You shaking the bee&amp;#39;s nest of his ego is helping him climb up over his mistakes.&amp;#34;She leaned back in that chair and smiled to her beneath the dimness of that hood she had on.&amp;#34;I owe you a kindness, homie. Oh and me just killing the man? It doesn&amp;#39;t prove anything. everyone knows that I could of. Thats why I didn&amp;#39;t. Its too easy.&amp;#34;||0"

Hannah Dalton,,"vtr.png|#000000|12px|verdana|&amp;#96;Yeah, IÂ´m sure the fact youÂ´d get shitkicked for offing the casino-whale has nothing to do with it.Â´ she smirked, bit dismissive, bit light-hearted, full-on Hannah. Â´But that whale ainÂ´t never gonna climb up over his mistakes, because heÂ´ll just keep on making them. You know that, I know that. Everyone does.Â´||0"
Madison Gray,Alice Stepford,vtr.png|#000000|12px|verdana|Put her to work in your kitchens  :p||0
Madison Gray,David Su,"vtr.png|#000000|12px|verdana|Sure, she has some redundant titltes and will be gaining even more soon.||0"
Madison Gray,David Su,vtr.png|#000000|12px|verdana|it can be confusing to people||0
Madison Gray,,"vtr.png|#000000|12px|verdana|&amp;#34;Fuck, lookit you. For all your dismissive attitude you understand the Unconquered pretty good. You&amp;#39;re right I&amp;#39;m an opportunist and he&amp;#39;s my beached whale.&amp;#34;A little laugh leaving her lips.&amp;#34;This is good, I was worried you might of had the wrong idea on things from the rumors. But it sounds like you got it all straight.&amp;#34; ||0"
Hannah Dalton,,"vtr.png|#000000|12px|verdana|&amp;#96;Straight turns queer real fast though, just ask that pastor whatÂ´s his face. Look at straight porn long enough and you get bored and then you want twat up your face and pretty soon youÂ´re fucking animals. CanÂ´t think of an analogy for our existence that is both more fucked up and accurate. So donÂ´t think I ainÂ´t sleeping with one eye open just cause this little pebble didnÂ´t flip over the car.Â´||0"
Madison Gray,Alice Stepford,vtr.png|#000000|12px|verdana|heh heh||0
Madison Gray,,"vtr.png|#000000|12px|verdana|&amp;#34;Colorful, thanks for that little image. But I wont forget when I&amp;#39;m being called Baroness, Maester, hell whatever titles I gain that it all started to a Carthian that called a Ventrue &amp;#39;Karin&amp;#39;. Its fucking beautiful isn&amp;#39;t it?&amp;#34;She grinned and then giggled a bit far more like the teenage persona that long dead creature used to be.&amp;#34;Oh and sorry if I&amp;#39;m a little vague at Times Hannah. But you seem to understand the game a bit more than you lead on anyhow. Is there anything I can do for you tonight? Or should I let you get back to your biz, girl?&amp;#34; ||0"
Hannah Dalton,,"vtr.png|#000000|12px|verdana|&amp;#96;You know, I donÂ´t get it. The Invictus is a dead end for someone like you, youÂ´ve got to be aware of this fact. There ainÂ´t no way theyÂ´ll ever let someone like you become a Baroness, and even if by some miracle the entire fuckload of them got the M and decided to change their standards, itÂ´ll still take you forever to get there. Anything they offer, the movement offers except without all the bullshit strings. So I just donÂ´t get it.Â´||0"
Madison Gray,Alice Stepford,vtr.png|#000000|12px|verdana|Yea I know.||0
Madison Gray,,"vtr.png|#000000|12px|verdana|&amp;#34;You think its about Choices Hannah, and I&amp;#39;m making the wrong one. But you don&amp;#39;t see whats on the table for me. That life you&amp;#39;re offering it would make a hell of a lot of sense to the eighteen year old girl that died all those years back. I still wear her clothes, talk like her, look like her. Even your mind tells you I&amp;#39;m her as my curse begs you to grip your pistol and watch your wallet. But the truth is I&amp;#39;m part of one of the oldest orders that exist within the Invictus. Were dirty and hate, but were that for a reason..I think I heard you called me a &amp;#39;gutter knight&amp;#39; right? Hell that almost sounds a step up from Leper.&amp;#34;She said with a little wink.||0"
Madison Gray,Gideon Ward,vtr.png|#000000|12px|verdana|Haha nah were having a decent scene.||0
Madison Gray,Gideon Ward,vtr.png|#000000|12px|verdana|Madi heard Hannah got wind of what happened so she wanted her to get more than rumors.||0
Madison Gray,Alice Stepford,vtr.png|#000000|12px|verdana|Yea it was stupid and the way he insulted and betrayed Madi was retarded||0
Hannah Dalton,,"vtr.png|#000000|12px|verdana|&amp;#96;That just sounds like a bunch of self-justifying bullshit. Lookatme, IÂ´ve got ancient blood in me, ainÂ´t that something to be proud of, weÂ´ve got honor us. Fuck honor, thatÂ´s just a fancy word the lords sweettalk you with to keep you in line. You ainÂ´t nothing but a tool to them, someone willing to get her hands dirty, pay her dues. But youÂ´ll be paying those dues for the rest of your existence and theyÂ´ll keep treating you like the shit underneath their boots. You and me, we ainÂ´t so different you see. We were both already dead before weÂ´d actually gone and died in the flesh, people like us donÂ´t get to sit up there with the guys in suits, and we shouldnÂ´t want to either.&amp;#96;||0"
Madison Gray,,"vtr.png|#000000|12px|verdana|A slight smile was on her face as Hannah talked.&amp;#34;You&amp;#39;re pretty inspiring you know that? Hell if I was a fledgling soldier I might&amp;#39;ve been sold. But I&amp;#39;m a knight Hannah, I know that sounds stupid to you and maybe even makes me look like a bit of a tool. But I like it, it gives me purpose in this unlife and its all I&amp;#39;ve ever known since I woke up after taking two in the chest from some Blood. I appreciate the offer. We can still be homies yea? Even if we don&amp;#39;t wear the same colors on the street. Might do you good to have at least one Invictus you don&amp;#39;t hate.&amp;#34;||0"
Hannah Dalton,,vtr.png|#000000|12px|verdana|&amp;#96;I donÂ´t wear colors on the streets. IÂ´m an independent contractor.Â´||0
Madison Gray,Alice Stepford,vtr.png|#000000|12px|verdana|yup not to mention theres who way he could face in monomacy. Anyone high in the Invictus has to be able to fight on some level||0
Madison Gray,,"vtr.png|#000000|12px|verdana|&amp;#34;Good, maybe you can come by the chapter house one of these nights after I get it up and running. There&amp;#39;s always work for women like us.&amp;#34;She said moving to stand up.&amp;#34;Like the pistol by the way..Even if I like to one hand ten gauge hand cannons. Isn&amp;#39;t being dead great?&amp;#34;The haunt said with a little snicker about that unnatural strength as she got ready to take off.||0"
Hannah Dalton,,vtr.png|#000000|12px|verdana|Â´Chapter house?Â´||0
Madison Gray,,"vtr.png|#000000|12px|verdana|&amp;#34;Yea It&amp;#39;ll be news soon girl. Hold onto your ass cause the second act of my little game is coming up.&amp;#34;Giving her a finger pistol in a somewhat dorky manner, winking under the hood as she put those glasses back on and moved towards the door. ||0"
Madison Gray,Alice Stepford,vtr.png|#000000|12px|verdana|Didn&amp;#39;t stop madi from bending her over a oven. Kinda turned her on a little haha.||0
Hannah Dalton,,"vtr.png|#000000|12px|verdana|Finally, Hannah picked her gun back up from off the table, put the safety back on, and put it away.||0"
