29 Sep 2013, 22:27:01 Marissa Collins : ** Marissa Collins has joined the room ...
29 Sep 2013, 22:27:05 -Garmr- : (taps)
29 Sep 2013, 22:27:57 -Transit- : *is passing through the mortal bar on her way downstairs, back pack, black coveralls, stitched name tag says 'Marcus'
29 Sep 2013, 22:29:52 -Transit- : ** -Transit- has left the room ...
29 Sep 2013, 22:30:02 -Transit- : ** -Transit- has joined the room ...
29 Sep 2013, 22:30:54 -Transit- : (wow, amazing Ling pics)
29 Sep 2013, 22:31:41 -Smoke- : Smoke was sitting in a booth leaned up against Garmr with the other woman squired against the inside of the seat. Looking over a menu as her stomach was grumbling slightly. "Mm what'cha think Garmy, should I get something vegetarian or just say suck it tonight?"She asked turning her head and looking up at her curiously as she yawned a little bit and stretched out again with a little sigh if relief.
29 Sep 2013, 22:31:43 Marissa Collins : ( thanks )
29 Sep 2013, 22:33:09 -Transit- : *sees Smoke and Garmr and smiles, she slows at their table "Food better up here?"
29 Sep 2013, 22:33:48 -Smoke- : of*
29 Sep 2013, 22:35:26 -Garmr- : Her own gaze riveted over the menu with that crazt metabolism of hers with both age and hard daily exercises. Her own stomach growled and she put her chin on top of Smoke's shoulder. "Fuck vegetarian... I need something that may still bleed.." A dark chuckle and then she looked to Transit. "Trying it out... I could eat anything." She faux bit Smoke's shoulder at that statement and laughed.
29 Sep 2013, 22:35:51 -Transit- : :I know what you mean."
29 Sep 2013, 22:35:55 -Transit- : I know
29 Sep 2013, 22:37:08 -Smoke- : ((afk a brief sec ill post when i return
29 Sep 2013, 22:40:22 Marissa Collins : Marissa had returned to the Pirates' House to get something to eat. She had been here once before, and the food had been pretty decent from what she could remember. Although to be fair, her recollections of the meal itself were hazy at best. She stepped inside the establishment dressed in a somewhat short, pleated skirt with a green, red, and black tartan pattern and a snug dark gray halterneck top that left her arms and shoulders bare. A wide leather belt with a robust steel buckle adorned her waist, obviously worn as an accessory.
29 Sep 2013, 22:40:27 -Transit- : ** -Transit- has left the room ...
29 Sep 2013, 22:40:33 -Transit- : ** -Transit- has joined the room ...
29 Sep 2013, 22:45:02 -Smoke- : "Ohhh fine I'll get a burger and fries but you gotta help me eat all that you lil carnivore."She said to Garmr and looked up at Transit."Heh yea they wont serve downstairs due to the fact they're not supposed to go down and that I guess. So if ya want a meal ya gotta come up chica."Those blue eyes widened a little bit seeing Marissa come in again as Garmr could feel Smokes heart quicken a little bit at the sight of that beautiful faerie once more as she gave a bit of a bashful smile and a little wave towards her.
29 Sep 2013, 22:46:43 -Garmr- : The silver symbol hanging from the leather cord around her neck caught the light sometimes when she leaned over or shifted which like a restless teen she seemed to do a lot; other Magi saw it for it was, the rune for 'death'. It stood out nicely against her black tank top. Beside them over a chair was her leather jacket draped and resting on top of the table was her motorcycle helm. Otherwise she wore simply faded black jeans and combat boots, her hair hanging feral free and black.
29 Sep 2013, 22:48:52 -Garmr- : "I could eat you." She joked and chuckled at Smoke. "Sit, Transit... if you don't fill your belly you can't work..." Her words trailed off at the sight of Marissa and those dark eyes of hers gained a sharklike quality trailing her gaze over the changeling, a pitch black depth deepening in intensity like she could eat that one now.
29 Sep 2013, 22:52:46 Marissa Collins : Marissa's pale, blue gaze swept across the room as she entered, giving any lunch guests a quick glance before she stepped further inside, moving towards a free table. She stopped as she noticed a woman waving at her, looking over towards her. A sudden, spontaneous smile bloomed upon her lips as she realized it was Smoke and she raised a hand to wave back at her, beginning to move towards hers and Garmr's booth instead.
29 Sep 2013, 22:53:24 -Garmr- : (switching to computer)
29 Sep 2013, 22:53:26 -Garmr- : ** -Garmr- has left the room ...
29 Sep 2013, 22:53:41 -Garmr- : ** -Garmr- has joined the room ...
29 Sep 2013, 22:57:43 -Smoke- : Smokes eyes seemed to twinkle slightly as as she kept looking over Marissa as she came over. That heartbeat turning into a thumping of anticipation as she managed to speak finally."Hey again Marissa. I wasn't expecting to see you again so soon. You can totally sit down if you want."She said entranced for a few moments before snapping back to reality as she realized she was still laying against Garmr."Ohh t..this is Garmy, shes a kinda exchange student that came in from Sweden, and standing there is Tran shes ah uhh local Mechanic."She said shifting in place and trying to keep her cool, the woman's presence always seeming to blindside her.
29 Sep 2013, 22:58:15 -Transit- : *plops down with the two Arrows "So, how are kicks?"
29 Sep 2013, 22:59:19 -Malakim- : ** -Malakim- has joined the room ...
29 Sep 2013, 23:01:54 -Smoke- : ((i just filled Malakim in))
29 Sep 2013, 23:02:22 -Malakim- : Mal walked in, currently in a simple tshirt and jeans. She had a look of "I'm supposed to be here" down cold, but that was probably just a normal part of her personality and not something specific to where she actually happened to be. She nodded to those gathered, trying to place faces without looking like she was staring. She moved over to the bar to order something involving vitamins, water, and no alcohol.
29 Sep 2013, 23:02:24 Marissa Collins : As she drew nearer to their booth, Marissa could not help but notice Smoke's companion; it would have been impossible for her not to notice the intensity in those voracious eyes, managing to meet Garmr's eyes for but but the briefest of moments before looking away again. Luckily, Smoke started speaking to her, giving her an opportunity to shift her attention away without giving away her uncertainty. Or so she hoped, at least. "Ahh, hello there, pirate girl," Marissa said to Smoke, her voice soft and pleasant, before she gave each of the other women a nod. "Hello, miss Garmy. And miss Tran."
29 Sep 2013, 23:03:34 -Transit- : *looks at the lady and is like wise entranced, a slight jealous look crosses her face for a moment and then is gone "Holy nut balls. You are fucking georgeous."
29 Sep 2013, 23:03:58 -Transit- : "Why cant my hair be like that?"
29 Sep 2013, 23:05:55 -Garmr- : Her eyes sparked with dark appreciation slowly devouring the changeling's appearance layer after layer trailing over her like razorblades imagining taste and texture, slowly squeezing a napkin, fingers curled like silent claws. "Who is your friend?" She purred quietly to Smoke with a hint of something predatory in the tone of her voice and like she could lean over and take a bite of that disturbingly pretty face. Fortunate Transit managed to snap her out of the state of mind a little with language alone. "Hmm...? Ahh... this and that... studies, working out. Getting... hungry." She smiled darkly after the answer to Transit, looking at Marissa.
29 Sep 2013, 23:08:23 -Padawan- : ** -Padawan- has joined the room ...
29 Sep 2013, 23:09:37 -Transit- : ** -Transit- has left the room ...
29 Sep 2013, 23:09:42 -Transit- : ** -Transit- has joined the room ...
29 Sep 2013, 23:09:50 -Transit- : (stupid mouse)
29 Sep 2013, 23:09:59 -Padawan- : (test)
29 Sep 2013, 23:10:16 -Transit- : *is sitting with SMoke and Garmr
29 Sep 2013, 23:10:22 -Transit- : (I see you)
29 Sep 2013, 23:10:49 -Padawan- : (gah, i borked my PM's when i switched rooms. brb, gonna log all the way out and back in)
29 Sep 2013, 23:10:56 -Padawan- : ** -Padawan- has left the room ...
29 Sep 2013, 23:11:02 Marissa Collins : Marissa blinked her eyes. Then she blinked again. Apparently, she was not used to that sort of blunt frankness. She took a seat next to Transit, or 'Tran', as Smoke had called her, and smiled tentatively at her. "Well, ah, someone once told me that beauty is only skin deep," she said in a diplomatic tone, rolling her shoulders in a casual half-shrug. The rest of the saying was something like, 'but ugly cuts right to the bone', but she decided to leave that part out. She turned to Smoke, unable to keep that smile from resurfacing upon her lips, "So, ahh, how have you been? I do hope everything is alright with you." It was hard, but she made an effort to ignore Garmr's stare. So very hard.
29 Sep 2013, 23:11:55 -Padawan- : ** -Padawan- has joined the room ...
29 Sep 2013, 23:12:22 -Smoke- : "Oh this is Marissa, she kinda wandered in here a couple days ago and we sort've hit it off Garm."She said with a bit of a bashful smile and slightly reddening of her cheeks. Garmr had never seen this side of Smoke likely as Marissa actually seemed to get her off balance in a way few could."You want to join us for another meal Marissa? It wouldn't be a bother for anything. Its kinda nice you get to meet some of my friends anyway. Trying to wind down after a bit of a wild night of college football anyhow."Every word seeming almost awkward and forced as if she had to wrench her heart from her throat each time she spoke."Y..yeah everything is totally fine with me, I'm great! I hope you're doing alright as well?"
29 Sep 2013, 23:12:25 -Malakim- : She grabbed her bottle once she'd paid for it, leaning against the bar to observe the room a bit more as she drank. She settled into the sort of stance someone who was very used to standing still for very long periods of time took, using the counter to lock into place and relax at the same time.
29 Sep 2013, 23:14:38 -Padawan- : strolls into the room, backpack over his shoulder, his hair wet. The gangly young man glances around and spots a few people he knows, altering his approach to meet up with them. "Evening ladies." He says in a pleasant tone. "How are you tonight?"
29 Sep 2013, 23:15:23 -Smoke- : ((atm were all at a table save for Malakim who is at the bar just for referance))
29 Sep 2013, 23:15:33 -Padawan- : (thanks)
29 Sep 2013, 23:16:48 -Transit- : *looks up at her Paddy and her face gets serious "Sorry gang, gots to motor with this boy toy here." *she jumps up with her back pack, and walks over to Paddy* "I have something to show you!" *smiles and drags the Arrow out of the bar with haste
29 Sep 2013, 23:17:08 -Transit- : (umm, not 'her' Paddy, mistype)
29 Sep 2013, 23:17:17 -Transit- : (though soon he will be muwhahahahah!)
29 Sep 2013, 23:17:26 -Transit- : (j/k)
29 Sep 2013, 23:17:59 -Garmr- : Noticing something in the corner of her eye her gaze snapped from the devouring stare of Marissa to Malakim and had straightened a little from her youthful slouch to slowly blink the darkness away from her gaze and disarm the situation with a smile deepening the dimple in her cheek. "That's awesome..." She leaned away a little from Smoke to give her some space with the beauty and took out a pack of cigarettes for herself.
29 Sep 2013, 23:18:24 -Padawan- : "Buh, wut? wha....hey!" Stutters, confused as he is summarily guided away from the table. "Um..." he says towards the fading form of Smoke and Garm "Um, bye!"
29 Sep 2013, 23:19:28 -Garmr- : "Bye." She studied Padawan with the slowly gathered cold calm about her and lowered her hand to the shadows under the table for focus.
29 Sep 2013, 23:20:59 -Malakim- : She continued to relax and casually people-watch with exacting, slightly twitchy eyes of someone good at looking for fine details. She took another drink and took out her cell phone to occasionally tap at it.
29 Sep 2013, 23:21:10 -Transit- : *she wraps an arm around his shoulder and chuckles "So you going to be a pimp or ride bitch?" *no other indication what she means as she leads him outside
29 Sep 2013, 23:21:33 Marissa Collins : Marissa could not help but notice the contrast between Smoke and Garmr -- one was so sweet and and pleasant and charming whilst the other seemed more like a wolf, predatory and dangerous. She looked up at Padawan and Transit, raising a hand to wave at them. "Take care, miss Tran," she said, a faint smile tugging at the corners of her lips.
29 Sep 2013, 23:22:19 -Padawan- : "Um...I guess for lack of better options....pimp?" He says this, not sounding too sure if it's actually the better choice, and heads out.
29 Sep 2013, 23:23:21 -Padawan- : ** -Padawan- has left the room ...
29 Sep 2013, 23:23:24 -Transit- : *looks back with a slight longing look at the Fae (with Striking Looks 5 billion) and shakes her head as if she is trying to clear it
29 Sep 2013, 23:23:41 -Transit- : ** -Transit- has left the room ...
29 Sep 2013, 23:24:45 -Smoke- : Smoke gave a lazy little wave to Padawan as he was dragged away."Hey pad, bye pad, bye Tan."She said leaning forward."I was thinking of getting a hamburger but they also have some really great salads here as well Marissa. I uhh, wanted to tell you last time I well..I had a lot of fun just sort've getting to know you and well saying goodbye wasn't bad either..Though a little bittersweet when things had to end."The sheer sappy natures of her words worst both sweet and disgusting like a rich chocolate no doubt to onlookers given Smokes infatuated nature with the changeling.
29 Sep 2013, 23:26:41 -Garmr- : She closed her eyes for a moment before she determined pushed out of her seat and tapped up a cigarette from the pack to her lips to catch and slightly moisten at the end. The death rune danced over the fabric of her shirt when she did. "I'm getting something to eat..." She growled softly and left Smoke and Marissa by the table with a dark last look raking over the extremely beautiful changeling before she made her way over to the bar instead and dug up some bills from her pocket.
29 Sep 2013, 23:29:52 Marissa Collins : Marissa shook her head lightly, then pulled her chair a bit closer to the table, resting her hands against its edge. Idly, she began drumming her fingertips against its surface, her black nails clicking softly. "Ahh, I would not mind getting something to eat, to be honest." Marissa felt invigorated by Smoke's cheerful disposition, as if somehow that other woman's enthusiasm were rubbing off on her. "A burger does sound delicious. Mhhm. I hear it is the standard fare for pirates at shore. And.. ah, it was a bit bittersweet and weird and still very delightful, all at the same time. I, uh... I had actually been meaning to call you, but I sort of lost your number." She bit down on her lower lip, chewing on it lightly, "I think I am a bit absentminded, sometimes."
29 Sep 2013, 23:33:20 -Malakim- : She seemed to pause, at something, and sniffed. She muttered, and shook her head, and took a deep drink from her bottle as she glanced over the room again as her "other" senses kicked in. She nodded politely to Garmr from her place leaning against the bar.
29 Sep 2013, 23:36:34 -Smoke- : Smoke couldn't help but laugh slightly at Marissa' words and nodded smiling brightly at her."Ohh you don't need to feel bad those kinds of things happen Marissa. I know my life has been a little crazy lately, I uhh thought that maybe we could.."she said interrupted by the approaching server as she ordered her meal and then looked over seeing Garmr had walked off finally as her heart sunk slightly before looking back to Marissa being reinvigorated by the womans charm."I guess it silly I probably shouldn't even ask..I..I can't imagine what you would see in a tomboyish person like me Marissa..You're just..You're so amazing."
29 Sep 2013, 23:38:25 -Garmr- : "Helvete..." She muttered when she remembered where she was and let the cigarette slip back in place and pocketing the pack and zippo again. Allowing her gaze to rest on Marissa once more as her gaze briefly was clouded with a baleful wanton rising like black fire through the Moros soul. A slow, needlesharp smile when she slowly reigned herself in and ordered a burger at the bar, turning to Malakim for suitable distraction. "Garmr." She introduced herself and held her hand out.
29 Sep 2013, 23:42:28 -Malakim- : "Mal." She took the proffered hand. "Rough evening?" She took another drink of what was apparently vitamin water. "Nice necklace." She added, nodding towards the symbol.
29 Sep 2013, 23:45:27 -Garmr- : "Hard exercise. My stomach turns into a bottomless pit I swear." She glanced over Malakim realizing her shape. "How do you bulk? Or hell for that matter... stave of that hunger." A nod towards the bottle of vitamin water she drank. A glance down for a moment . "Thanks. I made it."
29 Sep 2013, 23:45:31 Marissa Collins : "You're exaggerating," she replied, shaking her head lightly, "Look, the only thing I know about you is that you're called Smoke. And that you're a pirate. But apart from that, you're just another stranger I happened to bump into. I don't even know your real name." Although the conversation was fairly casual, Marissa's voice was warm and gentle, her eyes searching Smoke's face. "You can't imagine what I see in you? Well, I have no idea what you have seen in me, either. But I would like to find out. Basically, I enjoyed talking to you that evening. And you made me laugh. Not many people have done that, recently. I figured that'd be a good enough reason to see you again. Ahh." Marissa reached up to brush a hand through her hair, her fingertips burying into her soft, blonde locks.
29 Sep 2013, 23:48:29 -Malakim- : "Planning, discipline. Dietary rotations. Little extra nudge here and there when I need it. I have a lot of practice, needed it. Oh, you did?" Referring to the necklace again. "Little Mor-bid..." She emphasized the first syllable slightly. "But I like it."
29 Sep 2013, 23:49:40 -Smoke- : "R..really? Well I guess we could go out sometime maybe..I was thinking about getting some tickets for a steam boat ride along the Savannah River. Its supposed to be pretty lovely at night and everything if that sounds like something you'd want to do Marissa I mean if you're not to busy one night?"She asked hopeful and nervous in the same moment."I guess I'm just a little intimidated by you is all, If I am a pirate than you're my sunken treasure always seeming just a little too deep to grasp at."
29 Sep 2013, 23:53:55 -Garmr- : She shifted a quick glance over to the pair by the table with a dark smile and a shake of her head thinking about something before she turned full focus to Malakim. "It's precisely what it is... Mor-bid." She mimiced Mal's way of saying it, soaking it up quickly. "I got some hobbies... archery... but I do sculpting for fun."
29 Sep 2013, 23:56:11 -Malakim- : She tilted her head to one side. "Sculpting, huh. Can't say I've ever been heavy into art stuff much. I've been pretty busy lately between a couple of jobs and all the new stuff I have to learn for this club I found myself in."
30 Sep 2013, 00:00:15 -Garmr- : "Art keeps you on the straight and narrow path. Can't think about much else when you focus on it and hell... you even forget other things for a while." She seemed to relax a little more forgetting about the table with the beauty and the... "I could show you sometime. What do you do at the club?"
30 Sep 2013, 00:00:19 Marissa Collins : Steam boats? Sunken treasure? Too deep to grasp at? Marissa was not really sure how to respond to all of that, so she simply smiled brightly at Smoke. "Why don't we just get something to eat now, enjoy each others' company, and then work things from there? I, uh, like I said, I still don't know you very well. And my mom always told me never to get into pretty strangers' boats." Marissa's smile transformed into a wide grin, her eyes gleaming with amusement. "So, uhm... what do you? I mean, when you're not off attacking trade caravans or ransacking ports?"
30 Sep 2013, 00:03:44 -Malakim- : "I mostly focus on the opposite side of that coin you're wearing." Nodding towards the necklace again. "I know exactly what you mean about the art, though. That's exactly how I feel when I'm working out."
30 Sep 2013, 00:04:37 -Smoke- : Smoke let off a bit of a girlish giggle at Marissa' joke as she nodded"Oh I'm uhh, a bounty hunter. When someone gets out on bail and tries to run away or does pay I bring them in..Theres always bounties for really bad criminals that the police or some other organization want that I try to find. It's nice cause I get to set my own hours and get rid of some really nasty people out there that would do bad guy stuff to others ya know."She said taking a little pride in her work obviously."It makes me feel good whenever I know I'm stopping someone from getting away with something they deserve to rot for."said as their food arrived.
30 Sep 2013, 00:07:09 -Malakim- : Mal sank onto the barstool behind her, leaning back and propping her elbows on the bar. "Nother one, please." She said to someone tending bar, holding up her empty bottle.
30 Sep 2013, 00:08:41 -Garmr- : She paused and actually smiled more genuine. "For real? I feel like that when I work out as well." Glancing down to the necklace once more. "Ecstatic."
30 Sep 2013, 00:13:21 Marissa Collins : She was not sure if that was joking or not. Smoke was a -friggen- bounty hunter? After a few moments, Marissa realized she should close her mouth. Apparently, she had been gaping in disbelief at Smoke. It became more to Smoke than Marissa could ever have guessed -- had she really been teasing a bounty hunter about being a pirate? This was so surreal. "Wow," she finally mumbled, rubbing the side of her neck. "That is.. just, wow. That is amazing. But it does sound a bit dangerous. Gee, I'm honestly not really sure what to say. This is the first time I've met a real bounty hunter, I think."
30 Sep 2013, 00:14:00 -Malakim- : "That's me." She chuckled slightly. "Or at least a path I've been walking." She took another deep drink once her next one had arrived. "But yeah. That part where you hit that zone between the struggle to get started and the exhaustion later and you're just...going with it. It's an awesome feeling."
30 Sep 2013, 00:17:16 -Smoke- : "Its uhh nothing special, I mean most days are just dragging whining or cracked out losers back to the bondsman to pay their debts or go back to the courthouse. Its pretty rare you actually come up against someone who will try to resist and all."She said with a little smile "But I guess some days can be a little interesting."Smoke started to eat s she sighed dreamily looking to Marissa as she did the same."How about you Marissa, what is it you get up to when you're not making people like me feel like they're spending time with an angel?"Yet another sap covered comment from the love drunk young mage.
30 Sep 2013, 00:20:30 -Garmr- : (I forgot the time, have to run. Insert exit. Sorry!)
30 Sep 2013, 00:20:41 -Garmr- : (And thanks for all awesome rp)
30 Sep 2013, 00:21:01 -Garmr- : ** -Garmr- has left the room ...
