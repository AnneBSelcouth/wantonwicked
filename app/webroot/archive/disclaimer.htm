AFFIRM that you have READ and UNDERSTAND the rules and stipulations for play
presented by the Code of Conduct and this Disclaimer. Questions regarding either

<p><font face="Palatino Linotype">This fictional game is based off of <b><a href="http://www.white-wolf.com" target="_blank">White
Wolf Studios</a></b> role-playing game setting, World of Darkness, a grim and
bleak version of our own world. The creators and volunteers of this game (and by
extension site) make no challenge to the copyrights placed on the game and in no
way are generating revenue by providing this FREE java chat game for players to
play.</font></p>
<p><font face="Palatino Linotype">Adult themes are very much apart of this game
and it is suggested that those under the age of 18 let their parents know that
they are participating in such a game. While the overall &quot;public&quot;
rooms will remain more to a PG-13 tone the site administrators are not
responsible for every post made so it is very much play at your own risk if you
are easily offended. All characters however will be 18 or older as the site
administration has a zero tolerance policy on child pornography or anything
close to.</font></p>
<p><font face="Palatino Linotype">All participants of the chat must follow the <b><a href="http://site.exalted-online.net/temp/codeofconduct.htm">Code
of Conduct</a></b> which outlines what is appropriate for the chat and what is
not. The Code of Conduct is in no way a complete list of everything that should
and shouldn't happen in the chat and the site administration and Storytellers
(sometimes referred to as 'moderators') retain the right to change the Code of
Conduct as
circumstances dictate.</font></p>
