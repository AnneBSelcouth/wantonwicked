          action may occur for letting a simple swear out in the OOC, below is a

          continuously meta-gaming (and could go from Lv 1 to Lv 5) or someone
          threatening physical harm/stalking another or abusing a moderator. The
          Site Administration along with the Head Storyteller will have final
