Josephine's wardrobe is often spartan in its palette, allowing her to cut a figure that can often be overlooked, and changes her wardrobe as easily as a snake shedding its skin. Occasionally, however, she will don attire that one would think would befit a Succubus far more than a Haunt: antique velvet smoking jackets, Jeffrey Campbell platform boots, silk Oxford shirts. Josephine tempers such clothing with more understated pieces, not quite comfortable being so fully in the limelight.  %0a%0a-> %25color=#B8B8B8%25 The Haunt is never without sunglasses to mask enormous irises that are an animalistic yellow, the pupil constantly shifting beyond comfort in even normal light. As befitting her blood, the phalangeal bones of her fingers are just a little too long, lending her hands an eery elegance. Likewise, the spinous process of her lower cervical and thoracic vertebrae seem to extend past the normal net of tissue, causing raised nodules on her back that can be felt through most of her immaculately tailored attire.

His hands were not furred, he needed no graveyard dirt to sleep peacefully during the day. Despite his sobriquet, the Rat-Eater was a creature of refined tastes and careful gentility, who explained away his monstrous countenance with excuses of leprosy and drew the would-be Josephine to him by appealing to her intellect and innate curiosity. The Rat-Eater was known throughout Baltimore circles as an ''Au Pair,'' a master servant, who believed as fervently in the Invictus as some do in the Almighty.

She joined the Ordo to little fanfare, keeping her membership between herself and the Dragon while she studied the Coils. Those years were punctuated with writing to a comrade in Savannah and the careful study of chemical compositions, of learning the esoteric arts of scent.

Priding itself with compounding many of the fragrances in the small lab behind the store's counter as they are purchased by customers, Hermetica is a mix between a modern apothecary and alchemist's laboratory. More often than not Josephine is tucked away in the small lab in back, mixing base notes and doing research for new fragrances. Many of the names harken back to alchemical concepts, such as ''Aurum'', her signature perfume and ''eau de toilette'', which stands above the rest with soft gold luster and notes that promise the sun.

The Invictus may have borne her, but the Ordo is where she truly has found a home. While her Great Work is in its infancy, she has managed to learn two Coils, and seems oddly familiar with the Grand Wyrm for someone so new to the city. But for all her quiet fervor, Josephine has yet to truly make the leap. And as much as she savors her unbeating heart and the thrill of her Beast, the true embrace of such a life is not yet one she has found entirely palatable.     %0a%0a-> %25color=#B8B8B8%25 '''A Haunt in the Haunted City''' (Vampires) - New to Savannah and newer still to the kindred society found within it, Josephine is doing her best to push herself outside of the warm embrace of her laboratory and into the cold claws of socialization. For all of her stiff formalities, she seems sincere enough when it comes to getting to know others, willing to talk philosophies and hearing pet theories from other Covenants. And for someone who has been kindred for six years, her knowledge of vampiric society seems strangely limited to a relatively small scope. When not in the laboratory she has been taken to wandering the city at night.%0a%0a%25center%25http://i272.photobucket.com/albums/jj190/shokodragoness/Wanton%2520Wicked/24b57062-e2c7-4666-9242-09d298bad762_zps5ad0ec7e.jpg%25%25%0a%0a[[%3c%3c]]%0a%25%25http://wantonwicked.gamingsandbox.com/wiki/images/vtr/headers/vtr_con.png%0a%0a%0a-> %25color=#B8B8B8%25'''[[http://wantonwicked.gamingsandbox.com/wiki/index.php?n=Players.FrankieBurstrom|Frankie Burnstrom]]''' ''Anima'' - A brother in darkness, the pair have taken the traditional alliance of Mekhet and Nosferatu a step beyond.

Josephine tempers such clothing with more understated pieces. %0a%3c %0a%3c The Haunt is never without sunglasses to mask eyes that are just a little too-wide, the irises an animalistic yellow, the pupil always dilated beyond comfort in normal light. As befitting her blood, the phalangeal bones of her fingers are just a little too long, lending her hands an eery elegance. Likewise, the spinous process of her lower cervical and thoracic vertebrae seem to extend past the normal net of tissue and skin, causing raised nodules on her back that can be felt through most of her clothes. Nameless unease curls in the stomach whenever she is near.%0a%3c %0a%3c [[%3c%3c]]%0a%3c %25%25http://wantonwicked.gamingsandbox.com/wiki/images/vtr/headers/vtr_h.png%0a%3c %0a%3c There once was a young woman who loved plants and fungi more than she did anything else. But that woman is long-dead, and a monster wears her skin. The Rat-Eater of Baltimore, Herrick Eberhart, did not come for his youngest childe like some monster out of fable. His hands were not furred, he needed no graveyard dirt to sleep peacefully during the day. Despite his sobriquet, the Rat-Eater was a creature of refined tastes and careful gentility, who explained away his monstrous countenance with excuses of leprosy and drew the would-be Josephine to him by appealing to her intellect and innate curiosity which culminated in her serving as his ghoul for a year. The Rat-Eater was known throughout Baltimore circles as an ''Au Pair,'' a master servant, who believed as fervently in the Invictus as some do in the Almighty. %0a%3c %0a%3c Soon after her Embrace, Josephine was given to a Gulikan of no small esteem in Baltimore. Gaining neither esteem nor titles for herself, she nonetheless bent her mind to the task of being a glorified lab assistant until she paid off the debt her sire had accrued, studying the Coils during quiet moments spent with any Ordo that would teach her, writing to a comrade in Savannah.  The young Haunt left the City that Reads for Southern climes, and has opened her perfume boutique, ''Hermetica'' nearly a month prior to the Christmas rush. %0a%3c %0a%3c [[%3c%3c]]%0a%3c %25%25http://wantonwicked.gamingsandbox.com/wiki/images/vtr/headers/vtr_rph.png%0a%3c %0a%3c '''Bottling Memories''' (Anyone) - ''Hermetica'' is a new boutique situated in the Historical District that offers an artisanal range of house-made perfumes and other beauty products. Priding itself with compounding many of the fragrances in the small lab behind the store as they are purchased by customers, the store is both modern apothecary and alchemist's laboratory. On some nights Josephine herself can often be found behind the counter, although more often than not she is tucked away in the small laboratory in back, mixing base notes and doing research for new fragrances. Many of the names are especially fanciful, though the contents of the bottles are not. %0a%3c %0a%3c '''Thoroughly Modern Monster''' (Ordo) - As a newcomer to the Ordo, Josephine has a fire in her eyes that marks a recent convert. She speaks of the Ordo's methodology as one would a lover, and Josephine herself is no stranger to scientific rationale or the rigors of research. The Invictus may have borne her, but the Ordo is where she truly has found a home. While her great project is in its infancy, she has managed to master two Coils, and seems oddly familiar with the Grand Wyrm for someone so new to the city.   %0a%3c %0a%3c '''A Haunt in the Haunted City''' New to Savannah and newer still to the kindred society found within it, Josephine is doing her best to push herself outside of the warm embrace of her laboratory and into the cold claws of socialization. For all of her stiff formalities, she seems sincere enough when it comes to getting to know others, willing to talk philosophies and hearing pet theories from other Covenants.  %0a%3c %0a%3c [[%3c%3c]]%0a%3c %25%25http://wantonwicked.gamingsandbox.com/wiki/images/vtr/headers/vtr_con.png%0a%3c %0a%3c [[%3c%3c]]%0a%3c %25%25http://wantonwicked.gamingsandbox.com/wiki/images/vtr/headers/vtr_q.png%0a%3c ''“It was the secrets of heaven and earth that I desired to learn; and whether it was the outward substance of things or the inner spirit of nature and the mysterious soul of man that occupied me, still my inquiries were directed to the metaphysical, or in its highest sense, the physical secrets of the world.”'' -Mary Shelley, ''Frankenstein''%0a%3c %0a%3c %0a%3c %0a%3c [[%3c%3c]]%0a%3c (:include CityBook.VampireNavigationBar:)%0a\ No newline at end of file%0a
