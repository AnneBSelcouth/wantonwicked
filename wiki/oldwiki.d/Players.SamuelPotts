His father is of course high up within Potts Printing, and so he was raised in an upper middle class household, under the care of his mother, who, while she occasionally assists within the business, more or less stays at home. He was raised wanting little and having anything he really needed, but never had much interest in getting involved in the business himself. ''%0a%0a''He lost his voice when he was in middle school. it wasn't anything mysterious or special, though. It was something as simple as a car crash, a combination of blunt trauma and (thankfully nonfatal) lacerations doing too much damage to his vocal cords for him to be able to speak afterward. ''%0a%0a''The benefit of having the money his parents had, at least, meant he had a speedy recovery, and had a one on one tutor to teach him sign language, the boy just barely young enough at the time to let it become completely fluent in his mind. Still, this did give him a little bit of separation from other kids. While nobody would call him a loner, his circle of friends was generally a bit smaller than average, and fluctuated.''%0a%0a''Once he got through high school, he enrolled in Whitefield university, very much drawn in by the pamphlet and the general "sense" of the school for some reason. He enrolled with dual majors of Ancient Beliefs and Religions, and Library Studies. While his parents would've preferred Bright Moon university, they still supported him, and have been paying the costs for him, getting books to him and pulling what few strings they have there.''%0a%0a''He recently gained a work study of sorts within the school library, working there part time and can be found there generally late into the night, near when it closes.''%0a[[%3c%3c]]%0a%25%25http://wantonwicked.gamingsandbox.com/wiki/images/wod/headers/wodm_rph.png%0a'''Whitefield University (Any)''' - Not only does Samuel go to school there, he works the later shifts in the library part time, so you might catch him either in class or in the library... or occasionally sneaking about elsewhere.%0a%0a'''Weird Vibe (Occult, Supernatural)''' - Samuel has a tendency to get randomly distracted by nothing (really, by things in Twilight).
