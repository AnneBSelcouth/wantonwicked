Its patriarchs have earned much prestige through passing generations, yet were generally not above scandal.  The most famous member of the line is Bartholomew J. Sutherland I, a United States Congressman whose political career ended after he called FDR "that damn cripple" during a high stakes poker game with other high rollers in the back of an expensive Washington, DC steakhouse.  %0a%0aIt isn't too hard to find out that Bartholomew J. Sutherland III started an IT consulting firm, Millennium Computing, that was successful through much of the 90s.  It was an odd time for many businesses: computers were suddenly necessary, and though the number of homes with computers was on the rise, it was not yet the norm.  Ironically, Millennium Computing did not survive to the year 2000, as the business trend had transitioned to hiring in house IT staff by then.  After his business failed, he served on The Coastal Bank's Board of Directors.%0a%0aHis wife's kidnapping and callous murder was a major news item in Savannah through the month of April 2008.  Soon after, Bartholomew III started the Emma Sutherland Memorial Foundation, a charity which awards full ride scholarships to disadvantaged Georgia youth attending in state colleges and universities.  Five students are selected each year based on financial need, academic merit, and community service.%0a%0a'''Restricted Access (Sphere: High Society)'''%0a%0aBartholomew Sutherland II and his wife enjoyed romantic trips across the world and tragically died in a plane crash in February 2008, a few months after the recession started.  The family lost a fortune as the market plunged, and the taxes on the estate were so outrageous that Bartholomew III had no choice but to sell the plantation to cover the tab.  It was built by the Sutherland family and this was an outrage to the wealthy; the atrocities of the Estate Tax, also known as the Death Tax, were a frequent topic of discussion for a few weeks.  Most if not all of Savannah's elite families made sure their affairs were in order, lest the same happen to them.%0a%0a'''Restricted Access (Vampire Venue)'''%0a%0aIt was an odd thing.  Elijah had Embraced, and the childe spent his time at the Elysium, but did not make public appearances for two years.  Only Au Pairs and Elijah's House were permitted to see Bartholomew, who was secluded away in a private portion of the massive estate.  He was introduced to the city at a grand ball with much pomp and excess in Autumn 2011 as Master Bartholomew Jameson Sutherland III.  Even after this introduction, his public appearances were few and far between until his Manumission in Summer 2013.  For his generous charity work among the mortal herd as well as his offer to provide financial assistance to Kindred in genuine crisis, the Inner Council has named him an Almoner.  Though he is inexperienced, he was also granted a Title of Tribute -- Lord -- due to the overwhelming prestige of his Sire.%0a%0a'''Etiquette'''%0a%0a'''Formal''': Lord Almoner Sutherland%0a%0a'''Familiar''': Lord Bartholomew or Lord James%0a%0a'''Acceptable (non-Invictus)''': Lord Almoner Sutherland, Lord Sutherland, Almoner Sutherland, or Mister Sutherland.%0a%0a'''Introduction''': May I introduce Lord Almoner Bartholomew Jameson Sutherland III, Childe of the Most Impressive Alder Councilor Elijah, Keeper of Elysium.  %0a%0aLiving High Society characters call him Mister Sutherland or James depending on formality.%0a%0a[[%3c%3c]]%0a%25%25http://wantonwicked.gamingsandbox.com/wiki/images/vtr/headers/vtr_rph.png%0a%0a'''Loaded:''' Bartholomew has so much money, he gives it away to those with a real need.

Its patriarchs have earned much prestige through passing generations, yet were generally not above scandal.  The most famous member of the line is Bartholomew J. Sutherland I, a United States Congressman whose political career ended after he called FDR "that damn cripple" during a high stakes poker game with other high rollers in the back of an expensive Washington, DC steakhouse.  %0a%3c %0a%3c It isn't too hard to find out that Bartholomew J. Sutherland III started an IT consulting firm, Millennium Computing, that was successful through much of the 90s.  It was an odd time for many businesses: computers were suddenly necessary, and though the number of homes with computers was on the rise, it was not yet the norm.  Ironically, Millennium Computing did not survive to the year 2000, as the business trend had transitioned to hiring in house IT staff by then.  After his business failed, he served on The Coastal Bank's Board of Directors.%0a%3c %0a%3c His wife's kidnapping and callous murder was a major news item in Savannah through the month of April 2008.  Soon after, Bartholomew III started the Emma Sutherland Memorial Foundation, a charity which awards full ride scholarships to disadvantaged Georgia youth attending in state colleges and universities.  Five students are selected each year based on financial need, academic merit, and community service.%0a%3c %0a%3c '''Restricted Access (Sphere: High Society)'''%0a%3c %0a%3c Bartholomew Sutherland II and his wife enjoyed romantic trips across the world and tragically died in a plane crash in February 2008, a few months after the recession started.
