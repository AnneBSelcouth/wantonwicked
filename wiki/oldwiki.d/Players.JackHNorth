His face shows some hawk-like features, especially the blue-green eyes that sometimes grow menacing and predatory. Like most people in Savannah, he is sun-kissed and like most men, he struggles to remember his sun-screen despite spending more time outdoors than most people. If looked upon in the right setting of light, small scars can be seen embedded in the skin on his face, most likely the permanent souvenir from having taken a couple of beatings... Or acne. He has several tattoos on his body that the right (or wrong)  people might recognize. His most memorable features include his characteristic and charismatic roguish grin, and the thick Texas dialect. When he's working, he wears a typical workers outfit, cargo pants, dirty oiled up shirt, a baseball cab, working gloves and steel-toed shoes, but in his spare-time he favors jeans and flannel shirts, along with traditional cowboy boots, often sporting a fancy belt buckle. He's been known to sport a cowboy hat on occasions, but it's a rare sight, sometimes seen with a baseball cap on instead. On sunny days, he often wears a pair of aviator sun-glasses. He tends to smell of cologne, or oil, depending on whether he is coming from work or not. Rarely seen without his black digital military watch. While not always the case, he often carries a weapon concealed on his person (the trained eye might be able to tell that it's some sort of handgun, but most people will not notice), and he is further more rarely seen without his multi-tool strapped to his belt. %0a%0a[[%3c%3c]]%0a%25%25http://wantonwicked.gamingsandbox.com/wiki/images/wtf/headers/wtf_h.png%0a%25color=#996633%25Going by the name of Hunter, this young man moved into Savannah in an RV in the fall in 2011, although he seems to have found himself some other accommodations now, seeing as he drives a car with South Carolina plates (A black 4x4 Land Rover Discovery - Off-Road SUV). After but a few days, he found work with one of the local Gun Shops, as an educated Gun Smith (the only all-round licensed gunsmith in Savannah that doesn't exclusively work for the police or the military as far as I can tell). He is obviously from Texas, judging by his dialect. Since then, he has been seen around town, enrolling in various activities, but has managed to stay below the radar, not having made many friends if any at all.%0a%0a%25color=#996633%25The Local Forsaken will know that Hunter came to town, expecting to meet up with his pack, who were going to throw in with the local clutch, but they never made it, both were killed in an Ambush where Hunter got separated from them. He joined his pack in Dallas, and one of the members was supposedly related to the Reynolds. Other members of the Reynolds family might remember the sudden and mysterious death of one of the wolf-blooded Reynolds during the fall of 2011, which is supposedly what drew them to Savannah. At some point during the fall of 2013, he joined the Storm Lords in Savannah, initiated into the tribe by Lord Frostbite.%0a%0a%25color=#996633%25As of lately, Hunter has formed a pack called NIL along with a few other relatively new faces in Savannah, and they have taken up territory in South Carolina on the border of the Wild-Life refuge. As the only pack that far North, they are the last bastion of the Savannah forsaken on that front.   %0a%0a%25color=#996633%25Along with his pack, Hunter appears to be a strong supporter of the Clutch, which makes sense given his recent admission into the Lodge of Unity, which was based on his actions that ended up with the creation of the [[http://wantonwicked.gamingsandbox.com/wiki/index.php?n=CityBook.TheCamp|Boot Camp]].  %0a%0a[[%3c%3c]]%0a%25%25http://wantonwicked.gamingsandbox.com/wiki/images/wtf/headers/wtf_rph.png%0a%0a%0a*%25color=#996633%25''''+A hunter as man, a hunter as wolf, a Hunter in name+''''%0a%0a%25color=#996633%25All werewolves hunt, but Jack has been a game-hunter for years. You might know him from the local hunting associations. %0a%0a*%25color=#996633%25''''+A frequent bar-fly+''''%0a%0a%25color=#996633%25Jack spends some time frequenting bars in Savannah. He rarely drinks more than that he seems sober when he leaves, despite sticking mostly to whiskey. He could be drinking anywhere, you might have seen him at favorite bar once or twice and shared a drink or two with him.  %0a%0a*%25color=#996633%25''''+A real cowboy+''''%0a%0a%25color=#996633%25Jack owns a piece of land which used to be an old farm some decades ago, on the edge of town. He keeps a few animals, most interestingly, he keeps two horses that he rides around quite often. Further more, he frequents the gun range, where often sticks to his revolver. %0a%0a*%25color=#996633%25''''+Caged animal+''''%0a%0a%25color=#996633%25Jack was imprisoned in Mexico (briefly), and later Texas, from 2006 to 2008, but unless you sat in the same jail, chances of knowing anything about Jack's time spent behind bars are slim. Law-enforcement characters who have access to Jack's actual name might be able to find out about his prison sentence and may contact me for further information. %0a%25color=#996633%25Jack has a few prison tattoos, most of them discreet and not visible when Jack isn't shirtless, which he rarely is outside his home (See "Hobbyist" to get an idea of how/when your character might have had a chance to catch a glimpse of his tattoos). The trained eye might notice that some of the tattoos signify a very long sentence, as well as being in "Max Security". %0a%0a*%25color=#996633%25''''+Veteran+''''%0a%25color=#996633%25Jack had a short military career some years ago. He enlisted in 2003, in San Diego, as a Marine and left the Marine Corps in 2006 as a Sergeant First-Class. He only toured in Iraq. He isn't in contact with anyone from his old unit, apparently having completely left military life behind. Unless you actually served with Jack, there is no way of knowing of his military past as he hasn't mentioned it in conversation since, or kept in touch with anyone from the military. In the military, he was known as "(Insert Rank)Hunter". Unlike most veterans, Jack harbors no interest in the military, nor does he seem to feel any connection to other veterans. Jack's former military career is not something he broadcasts in anyway and in fact, since leaving the military, and even while there, only a select few people ever knew of his career there. Unless your character served with him, have contacts in the military (and reason to believe that Jack is a veteran, plus the motivation to find out)in or law-enforcement, the only way to find out would be to ask himself or the few people who know. %0a%0a*%25color=#996633%25''''+Handy-man+''''%0a%0a%25color=#996633%25Anyone who might frequent the area where Jack lives might have noticed that he's doing a bit of home-improvement. The house he bought was practically a ruin when he moved in, and while still no castle, it's coming along nicely. Anyone with an eye for real-estate will figure that he can flip it for more than he spent on it. You might have noticed him at the home-depot, shopping for materials. %0a%0a*%25color=#996633%25''''+Hobbyist+''''%0a%0a%25color=#996633%25Jack hits the nearest gym almost every day after work (Hyperformance Crossfit). He seems mostly interested in cross-fit training and cardio. Anyone who has trained with him will know that he isn't casual about his work-outs and has an admirable endurance, but that he mostly keeps to himself during his sessions. Other than that, he has been going around the different self-defense clubs in town on trial memberships to find something he likes. The place he practices now might be your club. He can also frequently be found swimming, preferring the ocean, but settles for a pool. %0a%0a*%25color=#996633%25''''+Career Criminal+''''%0a%25color=#996633%25Jack is known in certain circles as a man who can get things done.

When he's working, he wears a typical workers outfit, cargo pants, dirty oiled up shirt, a baseball cab, working gloves and steel-toed shoes, but in his spare-time he favors jeans and flannel shirts, along with traditional cowboy boots, often sporting a fancy belt buckle. He's been known to sport a cowboy hat on occasions, but it's a rare sight, sometimes seen with a baseball cap on instead. On sunny days, he often wears a pair of aviator sun-glasses. He tends to smell of cologne, or oil, depending on whether he is coming from work or not. Rarely seen without his black digital military watch. While not always the case, he often carries a weapon concealed on his person (the trained eye might be able to tell that it's some sort of handgun, but most people will not notice), and he is further more rarely seen without his multi-tool strapped to his belt. %0a%3c %0a---%0a> %25color=#996633%25''Jack, going by the name of Hunter, is a somewhat taller than average Caucasian male, looking fit and muscular as most of his kind.

Please ask permission before editing anything that isn't supposed to be added by others. If you feel that you absolutely must edit it (I won't take offense at someone fixing a typo or a code-error), please leave me a message of your reasons for doing so in an FPM, and don't throw a fit if I reject your reasons and revert it. %0a%3c %0a%3c Regarding quotes: I leave quotes that are supposed to be, roughly, my characters first impression of your character. This means the quote will most likely reflect what my character thinks of yours after the first scene in which they have been acquainted. %0a%3c It could also in some cases be my characters thoughts about your character at a given other time, depending on how well they know each other. If this is not the kind of quote you want left on your page, please feel free to remove my quote instead of being annoyed about it. Personally, I don't like quotes at all, but I was told that it was against the rules to remove the quote section from your wiki-page, although keep that in mind before you leave one. This is also not meant as an offense to anyone who might currently have a quote on my page, and should not be considered a request to remove them. I reserve the right to remove quotes I don't like/don't understand.%0a%3c %0a%3c Regarding "Contacts", I intend to use this section to keep a somewhat detailed record of all the characters my character has "officially" met, and what the general public might possibly know of their relationship if anything at all. If this is unacceptable to you, feel free to remove your character from the list entirely with the whole text section (don't simply edit it to fit your liking). %0a%3c %0a%3c In both cases, I don't want to be taking heat, insults or listen to remarks about my way of doing these things, how ever strange they might seem to you in particular. Please respect the fact that this is a wiki page online in a game function, and that if anyone wrote the book on how to do this, it's definitely not a best-seller where I'm from.  %0a%3c ----%0a
