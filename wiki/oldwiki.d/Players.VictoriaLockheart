Her figure is the same, a waif of a girl, but she lacks a slight measure of form.  Perhaps that chill you feel comes from her.''%0a---%0a> ''Victoria is a rather short slender woman standing at five feet tall and perhaps the type that needs a sandwich.  She has long bright royal blue hair and brownish red, cheerful eyes.  Her skin is fair and unblemished as all of her physical imperfections were forcibly removed during her time in Arcadia.  This is how she appears in her mask however.  Her mien is a different story entirely.  She's black as the darkest of nights with only dim blue clouds scattered about that only seem to add to the darkness covering her.  A stark contrast are her eyes which are a bright blue as if to show a measure of the beauty within.  She's a shadow given substance.''%0a
