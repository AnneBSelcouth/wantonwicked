I seem to be micromanaging Mage; you may even think I will tell you how to play the game. %0a%0aThis thought could not be more wrong. %0a%0aSome of you might go,“ WTF Hunter, wai you do this?” And the reason is simple. When you play in a table top game you can set the pace of the story with your ST, you can push the envelope because you know at a set time any given week that you will be rocking the dice and getting your supernal swerve on. These games are regular, you know the people you play with outside of the table, you know how they play, how they react, hell you might even be friends with some of them.%0a%0aOn an online platform you no longer have this luxury. You have to play with people located all over the world, in different countries and different time zones. Instead of those three or four people who interpret the rules like you do you now have to play with dozens of different styles and different opinions on how the game is played, much less run. This is where I come in.%0a%0aMost of what I type doesn’t change the core game. Yes there are some exceptions made, but for the most part I look to simplify things instead of making them more complex. What I am doing is establishing a level playing field. What is expected of you is the same that is expected of everyone else. The same legitimization for; experience, for status, for shiniez of all shapes and sizes now applies to everyone. These are expectations that you can hold one another accountable to, and more importantly, you can hold me accountable as well. %0a%0aI have been on Wanton for a while and there have always been grey areas that are left open to interpretation. Often times the fights on these interpretations have caused bad blood between players, between the storytellers, and even the administration. I am going to burn as much of that bad blood out before it becomes a problem. Is there a lot to take in, damn right there is, but you all are gamers, you know how to read and how to roll with the punches. If I didn’t think it would have worth I would not write it, so understand this is a commitment by me to you all, and not some massive grab to pigeon-hole the game. If anything, it sets the stage for more creativity because you know what to expect. You have all the information that takes the “what if’ out of dealing with someone you don’t know. You can decide %0a%0a[--%25color=#365776%25[[#top| Back to top]]--]%0a%0a[[#C]]%0a!!Cabals%0a%0aCabals:%0a%0aCabals are the fundamental building block of a Consilium. Outside of the orders, mages band together to form working groups with a shared interest. Because of this, and with the proposal that Troy has crafted based on his interpretation of the Revelations MUX, here is expectation of the work done on cabals. Before you read the next part I will let you know that cabals will have their own locked threads in which members can access.%0a%0aIntroduction%0aThe creation of a cabal is an example of an Iron Law (Silver Ladder, p. 73). The act of swearing an Iron oath infuses the mages’ words with power.%0a%0aA cabal’s formation establishes a mystical connection between different mages, a bond based on specific principles that echo in the Supernal Realms. The cabal’s power draws from the nature of its members: their beliefs, values, Path, Order, Legacy, worldview, and even their conflicts. They cannot withhold what makes them Awakened, and strange confluences sometimes occur.%0a%0aMages contribute something of themselves when they perform the ritual of cabalization, just as though they cast a spell. The members must share a core understanding of the cabal before they can even begin to attune themselves to one another. This corresponds to the imago of a spell; without seeing what they want to create, they cannot invest it with power. Specific symbols and imagery associated with their core credo establish anchorages in the Fallen World, and define the nature of the cabal. Only then can the latent power in the Supernal flow through to make the metaphysical bonds.%0a%0aThe Mystery revealed during the ritual resonates with power and significance, often revealed in flickers of vision, a shared understanding, and subtle signs for days and weeks after the cabal is formed. The Mystery cements the connection that holds Supernal resonance. %0a%0aJoining a Cabal%0aAt least three Wise are required to form a cabal. Mages join a cabal by performing a lengthy ceremony in a location associated with magic, like a hallow, a mountain peak or a tower, or a caucus building. They prepare symbols corresponding to the cabal's foundation theme and draw Supernal glyphs and swear the oath to one another to create a cabal. Each participant spends one point of Willpower and a point of Mana, then enters into communal meditation and visions lasting 16 hours.%0a%0aWhen a mage seeks to enter an existing cabal, any member can perform the cabal ritual with him. %0a%0aTheme%0aDecide your theme, the unifying theme, myth or motif for the cabal and its members. Themes can be founded upon nearly anything, but the cabal’s must hold mystical, spiritual, or symbolic significance for its members.%0a%0aPurpose%0aThe Purpose is the foundation for the cabal based on a particular set of beliefs. By nature, the Purpose is selective rather than all-encompassing. All participants contribute to the creation of these laws, even if they may not be consciously aware of the role. Purpose is a tool to designate what a cabal is about.%0a%0aThree maximum purposes branching off of this indicate what the cabal’s goals and interests are. They are frequently related to one another, and an offshoot of mutual Path or Order goals.%0a%0a•	Above: A goal rooted in the Supernal Realms. A focus or a goal rooted in Awakened society. %0a%0a•	Below: A goal pursued in the Fallen World. A ban or an aim directed at Sleepers. %0a%0a•	Ascension: A long term, ultimate goal. %0a%0aCategory%0aDetermine the primary ideal uniting a cabal and driving their actions.%0a%0a•	Allegiance: The cabal serves an area or a specific entity (spirit, Order, etc.).%0a %0a•	Endeavor: The cabal is driven by a shared, epic endeavor. %0a%0a•	Principle: The cabal serves an ideology or a philosophy.%0a %0a•	Questing: The cabal aims to complete a particular task. %0a%0aBenefits%0aSpecific benefits are determined by the cabal's Purpose. Benefits are selected at time of cabal creation and cannot be changed. If a new member joins the cabal, her dot for "Above" bonus can apply to an existing or a new Merit.%0a%0a•	Above: Each member contributes one dot to a shared cabal Merit pool. Dots may be split among multiple Merits or applied to a single Merit. Common choices include Social merits and Sanctum-related merits, such as Alchemical Lab and Library. %0a%0a•	Below: +1 to mundane, non-spellcasting rolls with a selected Skill. %0a%0a•	Ascension: Reroll failed dice on Wisdom degeneration checks when adhering to her cabal ethos. Violating the ethos is a Wisdom 3 sin. If it would be a Wisdom 1 or 2 sin, take a -2 penalty to avoid degeneration. %0a%0a•	Aura: Scarlet bands for oathbinding are visible on the mage's aura.%0a%0aLeaving a Cabal%0aTo leave an existing cabal, a mage declares her departure and breaks a symbol associated with the cabal's theme. A mage who departs with the blessing of the other cabal members suffers the following penalties:%0a%0a•	1 point of Willpower is immediately lost.%0a%0a•	All benefits are lost.%0a%0a•	Aura returns to normal.%0a%0a•	The cabal loses the Merit dot contributed by the member leaving. %0a%0aA mage violates the Iron Law by breaking a cabal oath, departing on poor terms or joining another cabal without properly leaving the first. The Diamond Orders see the failure to live up to the Iron Law as a sign of immaturity, untrustworthiness, and irresponsibility. Oathbreaking among the Adamantine Arrow is a serious matter which warrants immediate response, ranging from reprisals to death for the most grievous offenses. A Talon's word is their magic, a sacred trust never to be broken.%0a%0aAn oathbreaker suffers the following penalties:%0a%0a•	1 dot of Willpower is immediately lost.%0a%0a•	All benefits are lost.%0a%0a•	Aura returns to normal.%0a%0a•	-1 to all non-magical Social rolls with other mages for one season.%0a%0aAn Example%0aThe A-Team are a cabal dedicated to battling the corrupt influence of the Seers of the Throne, Scelesti, and even mortal authorities or other supernatural entities that weigh down the souls of Sleepers. Their theme is that they are a group mercenary renegade soldiers who specialize in infiltration, surveillance, counter-intelligence, and, of course, physical confrontation. If you have a problem, and if you can find them, maybe you can hire -- The A-Team. Their Shadownames are: Hannibal, Face, BA, Howling Mad Murdock, and Amy.%0a%0aTheme: Righteous Soldiers of Fortune%0a%0aPurpose:%0a%0ao	Above: To counter and destroy the influence, assets, and machinations of the Seers of the Throne.%0a%0ao	Below: To protect Sleepers preyed upon by corrupt individuals, be they Awakened or sleeper, or something in-between.%0a%0ao	Ascension: To preserve and uphold Justice and Freedom for all of humanity.%0aCategory: Endeavor%0a%0aMembers:%0a%0aDoorwarden: BA%0aHearthmaster: Hannibal%0aFarseeker: Face%0aLorekeeper: Amy%0a%0aBenefits:%0a%0a•	Above: +2 Contacts (Media, Criminal Underground), +2 Resources%0a%0a•	Below: +1 to Subterfuge rolls%0a%0aWith the information provided above you have an idea of how to create a cabal and word it. Copy pasta the above work and then fit your characters into the template as they are needed.%0a%0aWe are going to address the titles used in regards to cabal’s and sanctums. Since everyone has not gone and purchased Sanctum & Sigil, we are going to post some of the information here for you.%0a%0a%0aFirst off, the titles and what they roughly translate into:%0a%0aFarseeker: Scrounger, fixer, this is the person who finds needed resources for the cabal.%0a%0aDoorwarden: Bouncer, strong arm. Typically the defender of the sanctum or cabal.%0a%0aHearthmaster: Tender of the sanctum, also used as the head of the Sanctum or Cabal.%0a%0aLorekeeper: Another title used as the head of sanctum, but in charge of keeping the     history.%0a%0aEdgetender: In charge of the mystical resources (tender of the Hallow if you have one.%0a%0aNow the rights: %0a%0a[[#Lex-5]]%0a!!The Great Rights   %0a%0a(Click on the link for an expanded version of the great rights)%0a%0aRight of Crossing: Let no borders stop an Awakened with a clear heart.(How you let people in and across your boarders. Rules for travel.)%0a%0aRight of Emeritus: Those who have earned respect must be treated with respect.(How to treat guests, and how guests are supposed to act. This can get dicey at times.)%0a%0aRight of Hospitality: Those who request hospitality must be granted it.(How to ask for protection, but this can be revoked due to screwing up Emeritus)%0a%0aRight of Nemesis: When vengeance is declared, let none stand in its way.(How to declare war, the right of whoop ass)%0a	%0aRight of Sanctuary: Protect your home, and let no action cause it harm.(The ability to defend what is yours how you see fit.)%0a%0aNow, for a personal sanctum you still can enforce the rights, but it should be a recognized sanctum. Obviously you don’t need all the fancy titles to be displayed because you already wear too many hats. Personal sanctums and personal territory can be approved by the council.%0a%0a(Much of this was suggested by TroyR and was taken directly from one of his posts)%0a%0a[--%25color=#365776%25[[#top| Back to top]]--]%0a%0a[[#MC]]%0a!!Merits%0a%0aMerit Clarification:%0a%0aNo Merits from Bannishers, Seers of the Throne, or any “Antagonist” supplements are allowed at this time.%0aGeneralized Merits:%0a%0a'''Allies''' – Allies also have the ability to call on a player to perform favors%0a%0a'''Artifact''' – Not allowed at creation%0a%0a'''Contacts''' – Similar to allies, but they do not always have the answers players are looking for%0a%0a'''Eidetic Memory''' – Is not an automatic success, it is +2 to Int+ Comp to remember%0aEncyclopedic Knowledge – can be general but the information remembered will be just that, generalized in regards to obscure facts and information; or you can have a focus area for an actual roll.%0a%0a'''Fame''' – Fame 1 – Local, Fame 2 – Regional, Fame 3 national (potentially a fame 4 as international)%0a%0a'''Familiar''' – Requires appropriate level of Arcana to summon or “Employ”%0a%0a'''Resources''' – represent available cash after bills. %0a%0a'''Status''' – See different area on status%0a%0a'''Sanctum Guardians''' – Require appropriate arcana before they can be summoned or “employ”%0a%0aOther Merits%0a%0a'''EOD''' (Arm p. 208)%0a%0aExplosive Ordnance Disposal, as per the official White Wolf errata, is a 2 dot Merit, not 4.%0a%0a'''Emotional Detachment''' (Asy p. 50)%0a%0aEmotional detachment allows you to ignore stress penalties up to your resolve. It is not a catch all stone-cold-killer merit that means that you are unreadable and do not display feelings. There is no negative modifier that affect others if they are checking your aura or body language.  %0a%0a'''Entheogenic Synesthesia''' (MT. p. 137)%0a%0aThis merit allows a +1 to perception while using psychoactive drugs. However, the use of psychoactive pharmaceuticals has its own set of negative modifiers that will be in play during their use. %0a%0a'''Feral Mein''' (TotW p. 154)%0a%0aAn oft-used, and not-used-well Merit is Feral Mein. The character moves and/or talks in a way that is very primal and fascinating to onlookers. Specifically it can give bonus dice to seduce or scare. This bonus however may disappear if circumstances dictate such. If the character makes use of this merit frequently but fails to achieve a reputation for actually having some bite behind their bark, they might no longer gain the benefits of this merit. If another character can justifiably peg the user as being “all bark and no bite,” or “a tease,” then the character possessing this merit may no longer gain the +3 bonus against that defender, as the defender doesn't buy the image.%0a%0aIf this undesired reputation spreads to enough people, the character may lose the benefits of the merit altogether; their reputation precedes them, and unless corrected, others may be able to ignore the character’s Feral Mein for what it truly is...just an act.%0a%0aThis Merit, like Predator's Innocence, must be well-justified in the character background and the player must also be prepared to describe during sanctioning how they intend to portray their character's animalistic behavior.%0a%0a'''Fighting Style: Adamantine Hand''' (AA p. 53)%0a%0aOne of the prerequisites for this Fighting Style is to have five dots of Fighting Style merits, with at least one style at 3 dots or higher. These five Fighting Style dots must come from Brawl or Weaponry-based styles, as Adamantine Hand is a Brawl and Weaponry-based style. Adamantine Hand has been taught since the inception of the order and possibly earlier, well before the development of firearms. Sorry shootists, but Adamantine Hand is an anachronistic teaching that does not make use of modern tech.%0a%0a'''Fighting Style: Fencing''' (Arm p. 211)%0a%0aAs per the official White Wolf errata, the Riposte maneuver (3 dots) costs a Willpower point, which the player must spend as soon as he decides his character will apply twice his Defense to an incoming enemy attack.%0a%0a'''Fighting Style: Improvised Weaponry''' (MR p. 57)%0a%0aDue to an absurd interaction between the three dot maneuver (Breaking Point) and the Matter 3 spell Alter Integrity that was apparently overlooked by the merit's writer, Breaking Point now has the following limitation: the attacker may exchange no more points of Structure in a single attack than they have dots in Strength.%0a%0aThis to prevent exploitation of a mechanical loophole involving the use of Alter Integrity (to increase the Durability, and subsequently, the Structure of objects) in combination with this maneuver to create a single-use weapon with an absurdly high equipment bonus. This runs completely counter to the very concept of Alter Integrity, which is to make an object harder to break, which also runs counter to the intended display of Breaking Point, which is to break an object over the enemy. It’s also just not good game sense.%0a%0a'''Fighting Style: Staff''' (Arm p. 214)%0a%0aAs per the official White Wolf errata, the Dangerous Radius maneuver (3 dots) costs a Willpower point, which the player must spend before making any attack rolls.%0a%0a'''Good Time Management''' (Asy. 50, Rel. 84) %0a%0aCannot be used in conjunction with casting spells, especially extended casting spells. This would include working on imbued items or the creation of items when using arcana (inscribe grimoire etc.)%0a%0a'''Imbued Item''' (MtA p. 84)%0a%0a'''See Imbued Item House Rule'''%0a%0a'''Language''' (WoD p. 109)%0a%0aAs per the official White Wolf errata, Language is a 1 dot merit rather than a 1 to 3 dot merit.%0a%0a'''Multi-lingual''' (Rel p. 85)%0a%0aIt must be stressed that the languages granted by this merit only makes the character conversant in those (2) languages (per Dot;) that means they can speak it passably, but anything too fast or convoluted is going to give them trouble (as reflected in the rolls outlined in the merit) and reading or writing ANYTHING in the language requires a roll.%0a%0a'''Occultation''' (MtA p. 86)%0a%0aAs a reminder, this merit is completely incompatible with Fame; having one precludes your character from having the other. Furthermore, the benefits of Occultation can partly or even completely go away once the mage involves himself in Sleeper society, especially if the mage has attracted the attention of the mundane world (which can be something as simple as using Striking Looks to get a free drink at a bar to something as gross as robbing a bank with no mask and thus becoming the target of an FBI manhunt). This effectively makes it impossible for a mage to maintain any degree of Occultation and cultivate relationships with Sleepers at the same time.%0a%0aThe benefits of the merit return once Sleeper society has effectively forgotten the mage, which, depending on how entangled the mage has become in Sleeper affairs, could be anywhere from weeks, to years, or even decades.%0a%0a'''Predator's Innocence''' (TotW p. 154)%0a%0aA common misconception is that this Merit gives a character license to murder whenever he wants without making Wisdom rolls. Some take this a step further and think that possessing this Merit means their character is some kind of zen wolf-man who is unconcerned with human morality. These beliefs are not only incorrect, they are also rather silly.%0a%0aThe idea that mages are still human at their core is an essential part of the game. The Awakening does not radically alter a mage’s mind into something alien. Over time, a Master (likely a Thyrsus) with high enough Gnosis might have become crazy enough to start behaving in a way that is inconsistent with normal human behavior, but that's precisely what that kind of behavior is; madness. Predator's Innocence does not equal sociopathic tendencies with no repercussions. The key part of the Merit's text reads: “If the mage shows particular malice, if she tortures the subject before killing him or if she kills for morally questionable reasons, then the Storyteller might rule that a degeneration check is necessary.”%0a%0aThus, murdering someone for being “in my territory,” “challenging my dominance,” or “invading my personal space” are not behaviors that are protected by Predator's Innocence. Once again, self-defense, no other recourse, fight/flight killings are applicable. Walking up to a downed and unconscious person and putting a bullet in their head is not.%0a%0aThis Merit, like Feral Mein, must be well-justified in the character background and the player must be prepared to describe during sanctioning how they intend to portray the Merit.%0a%0a'''Sanctum''' (MtA p. 86)%0a%0a'''See Sanctum write up'''%0a%0a'''Striking Looks''' (WoD p. 117)%0a%0aA large number of chat players like to take Striking Looks at varying degrees, creating venues chock full of beautiful people. Without going into how unlikely it is for this to be the case, possessing the Striking Looks merit CAN be a hindrance. People with it are more likely to be stalked. People with it who commit crimes are more likely to be remembered and identified (the Striking Looks bonus becomes a bonus for the witness). So beware of this fact before you decide to have your Striking Looks 4 character raid a rival's sanctum in broad daylight whilst wearing a dress that emphasizes her subtle curves and absolutely no facial concealment.%0a%0aAlso! Even if your character does not have the Striking Looks merit, but can be commonly seen hanging out with a character who does, your character may be subject to a similar situational (albeit reduced) bonus when it comes to other people remembering your character or picking you out of a lineup. The more distinguishing marks your character has, the worse it is.%0a%0a'''Trained Observer''' (DoW p. 38)%0a%0aThis merit appeared in a book centered around military characters. It unfortunately has little in the way of concept text, thus leaving it up to us to divine its intent. We believe that the merit was intended to represent characters who have had practice at shutting out stressful outside distractions while observing their environment, like being able to notice an incoming flanking attack while under fire from machine guns and mortar, for example. Some law enforcement types are indeed able to do this, though it is important to remind everyone that this merit only relieves penalties for physical observation of one's environment. It gives absolutely no insight into intent or motive.%0a%0aAlso, regarding the three dot version of this merit, see the addendum regarding Rote Actions (link).%0a%0a'''Rote Actions''' (WoD p. 134)%0a%0aRote Actions are a system permutation that represent a character who either has detailed instructions to follow, or in some cases acts on muscle memory. It allows the character one reroll of any dice that came up on the initial roll as failures. This can be a potent mechanic, and there are several ways of achieving it. Some high-cost Merits grant it, but mages in particular have very easy access to some spells that can grant the ability.%0a%0aIn order to counterbalance the relatively common availability of this ability in the context of a Mage game, any Rote Action used - whether the action associated with it is Reflexive, Instant, or Extended, whether granted from magic or mundane ability - denies the user her Defense bonus for that turn. She focused on either following detailed instructions or following muscle memory. The outside world temporarily fades into the background for them while they carry out their action with zen-like efficiency, which unfortunately leaves them more open to a firm smack in the head.%0a%0aIn combat situations, this precludes the combining of Rote Actions and certain combat maneuvers, specifically ones that require the user to sacrifice their Defense for the turn. A character could not, for example, use a spell to perform a Rote action Weaponry attack AND declare the attack as All-out.%0a%0a[--%25color=#365776%25[[#top| Back to top]]--]%0a%0a%0a[[#SC]]%0a!!Sanctums%0a%0aSanctums:%0a%0aLike other supplements, not everyone will have access to a copy of Sanctum and Sigil. It is a good resource, as many of the books are, and there are aspects of the book that people will want to use. One of these aspects is the time spent on sanctums themselves. These are the abodes of the Awakened, the protective walls to hide the wonders of the ancients from the eyes of the sleeping world. %0a%0aThe idea is that a sanctum is a personal reflection of a mage, this is not so much home as it is a place of meditation, study, practice and power. You, as the player, can dress it up in whatever style you want, describing it in great or little detail, but you need to consider your character, as an Awakened mage practices away from prying eyes. Also, it is hard to claim territory as a singular mage, or as a cabal, without some form of established “base” (if you will) to operate from. %0a%0aThis said, the Sanctum, for singular mages or for cabals, as it is written in Sanctum and Sigil, is a sinkhole for merit points. It could bankrupt you if you were to follow its structure point for point. In the core, Sanctum is undefined. Sanctum in the core is pretty much a breakdown of size, and size in the core book gets a little ridiculous to be honest. You go from 1 dot (a 2 bedroom apartment) to 5 dot (Versailles.) This is just a little nuts, ok, maybe medium nuts. Sanctum and Sigil go the opposite route; you now have to spend dots of /everything./ By everything I mean locks, doors, windows, a garden gnome, exterior walls, interior walls and accent lighting. And this doesn’t even take into account things like wards, bans, ghosts, spirits or a cat.%0a%0a%0aWhat I want to see is this:%0a%0a1)	You must clearly define in your thread what your sanctum entails. Is it an entire apartment or one room? Is it the entire floor of a building or just half?  Is it the entire warehouse or just a hidden part? Your sanctum size will be dictated then by what you ask for/define. Here are some considerations we will take into account%0aa.	What are your resources? Can you afford the space? Can you afford the security?%0ab.	Do you possess the magic to defend the area?%0ac.	How much of this is habitable.%0a%0a2)	When you start buying security we are splitting this down into 2 sections mundane and supernal.%0aa.	Mundane security%0ai.	Can you afford it%0aii.	What is it? %0aiii.	Is it made to blend in or does it stick out%0aiv.	Did you pay for the work or do it yourself%0a%0aMundane security is where Sanctum and Sigil comes into play. See, I have some experience with Mages trying to get their B&E (That is breaking and entering for some of you out there) on, so defining a sanctum is actually important. So, to alleviate some of the point’s sink that is a sanctum here is how it will work. 1 dot in the sanctum merit will give you five points to spend across: size, exterior and interior construction, windows, locks, doors and security.  Yes, that is 7 categories and you only get 5 for the one dot. You have to decide what is the most important to you and then plan for the future. There will be ways to increase a sanctum’s various aspects.%0a%0aAlso, let’s talk about cabals and sanctums. If you have a cabal of 4 people and each one spends 1 dot on a communal sanctum then you have 20 points to play with, which means you could make a pretty decent sanctum in size and defense.  The size and scope of the sanctum will also have an effect on what can be held inside the sanctum. A 3 dot alchemical laboratory won’t really fit inside a one dot sanctum… as an example.%0a%0ab.	Supernal Security%0ai.	Wards and Bans%0aii.	Spirit Familiar%0aiii.	Ghost Familiar%0aiv.	Spell limitations%0a%0aYou might be wondering why you are being asked for all this information. It would be nice for me, as a storyteller, to be able to back you when you say “player X tried to break in but I would know because I have A,B,C and D working for me.” By setting it up this way, I can back you and what you might know even if you were not there. This also works for spells, in theory this will stop players from saying “Oh I cast that a while ago and I just didn’t thread it.” We can place this on individual character sheets OR in Cabal threads so that it is in game and there is no question to what is going on. %0a%0aSo, Supernal retainers/ guardians, etc.%0a%0aYou have to be able to cast the spell to summon, bind, enter negotiations with spirits and ghosts to become retainers and guardians. Same goes for ward and ban. Realize, these spells have costs and some will count against your overall spell tolerance. Since there is no “price for power” alternative for relinquishing spells, to keep the spell up and not have it count against you there will be a willpower cost.%0a%0aNow, before someone asks:” If I do not have the right arcana does this mean I won’t be allowed Supernal defenses.” No, it means you have to find someone to do a favor for you, and you will have to find a way to pay them for their work. This can go for spirits, ghosts, wards and bans.So before you spend the points make sure your ducks are in a row. This doesn’t stop you from renting a mage to help you, but that is done IC and they have every right to charge you at the whazzoo for their services (just like a real contractor.)%0a%0aNOTE: (Part I) The Summoning of spirits and ghosts and BINDING/ Negotiating with them works like this. The level of the arcana in use will dictate how strong of a ghost or spirit you can summon. This may change in the future, but there will be no rank five spirits who just happily go along with a thyrsus with spirit 3. %0a%0aNOTE: (Part II) – The “hiring” or binding of a spirit or a ghost will require a scene. With something that is being developed, this is more important that you realize and has the potential to really impact you later.%0a%0a%0aReasoning for all of this:%0a%0aI try to utilize some logic regarding what can and cannot be done in the real world to the game. Yes, it is still Mage, it can be a game of wondrous creations. Sure a Moros with some matter can make a kick ass wall, but to make it permanent will cost them severely.  You can say “well I do this every day when I get up, but if you do not thread the roll, or log the mana spent then you have no proof, and proof is needed to defend your statements. The accountability will be shared by both the storyteller(s) and the players. As always, I am not against you, I am trying to make a fair playing field on which EVERY player can operate. Whether you are brand new or ten years in, doesn’t matter, same rules apply. Sure, cabal’s have a communal sanctum, but many mages could have private sanctums as well. You can try and blend the properties or you can keep them separate. You can request a ghost familiar, get a scene in with an ST, spend the points and you have it and there is a reason for you to have it. Nothing is for free, you spend the points, we do the scene everyone is, and you have what you came for. This way everything has a paper trail, everything is tracked, recorded and you have a venue that everyone stands on the same surface to begin with. What you do with it in the future, that will be up to you and your role-playing.%0a%0a[--%25color=#365776%25[[#top| Back to top]]--]%0a%0a%0a[[#SCC]]%0a!!Scrutiny%0a%0aIt happens in almost every scene run. Something neat appears and then I get 4 or 5 posts of “I am scrutinizing this for 15 sux." The gun was just jumped, and so many times I want to send back “You get a rock." %0a%0aSO...let’s talk about the aspects of scrutiny:%0a%0a1) Before you do this your mage sight has to be up.%0a%0a2) You have to describe staring, focusing, paying direct attention to whatever you are scrutinizing BEFORE a roll is made and it must be a description posted in the main. NOW: If you are scrutinizing a person, you can try to do it on the down low but then the person gets a roll to notice you. IF, and I am making this call, If you try to scrutinize a person without them noticing, and you do not give them the option to roll (PC or NPC) then they automatically see you. There will be no " I forgot('s)." This begins with the first roll AND continues with all successive rolls. Bonus modifiers will go to the defender to notice as you sit there and creep them from across the room. There are no “scrutinize out of the corner of my eye" rolls.%0a%0a3) In a moderated (Re:  ST driven) scene I will roll Int+Occ (with any modifiers) after you identify what you were looking for. There is no mass, “I have 20 sux I know everything,” rolls. They go one at a time. Scrutiny is when you are looking for something specific, you are focusing, and there is a goal in mind.%0a%0aExamples: %0aQuote:%0a• Identity: (1 success) Each resonance or aura is as unique as a fingerprint. If a mage has seen or studied a resonance before and is familiar with it, one success allows him to recognize the subject. He can recognize the resonance of the subject regardless of any sort of physical disguise or transformation, allowing him to detect people in disguise or underthe effects of a transformative spell. With five successes, he can recognize shapeshifters in any of their forms. There are some means of disguising a subject’s resonance (see below). Note that powerful mages have strong auras. Their Gnosis gives others a bonus to notice and scrutinize their resonance. See “Gnosis,” pp. 75-76.%0a%0a• Nature: (1 success) Resonance reveals a subject’s truenature: human or inhuman, mortal or spirit, Sleeper orAwakened. One success is enough to alert the mage that theperson is not what he seems to be, but the mage doesn’t necessarily know what the subject really is. Five successes allow a mage to determine a subject’s true nature. Among other things, this insight allows the Awakened to recognize each other through resonance, unless concealed in some%0away. Mages can also pick supernatural beings such as vampires or shapeshifters out of a group of ordinary mortals, although they might not be able to identify what they are, only that they aren’t normal. Pg 278 M:tA Core%0a%0a%0a4) Extending Rolling: The effects are not cumulative. I am not going to tell you about this person's childhood because you got trigger happy with the dice roller. It doesn't work like that. You tell me what you are looking for, I roll, I give you answers. You decide if that is enough or if there is more, you say what you want to look for and then you roll again. This is an aspect that would be obvious in table top. You roll, you ask the ST, they give you answers, you roll again. For some reason the FF button got hit here and we go right to the rolls. %0a%0aFlip side of this, there is no more rolling 30 sux on scrutiny and I tell you “It’s a rock." You don't flip out and think I am screwing with you. When you get “It’s a rock" on 2 Sux you would know to move on. When you get it on 30 you feel I am messing with you. Sometimes there just is not as much there as you want it and you wasted your time. Sometimes it is just a rock.%0a%0aReread Pages 277- 280 please when you get a chance, it will help give better ideas on the love and hate of scrutiny.%0a%0a[--%25color=#365776%25[[#top| Back to top]]--]%0a%0a%0a[[#SpC]]%0a!!Spells%0a%0aSpell Clarifications:%0a%0aGeneral:%0a%0a'''Counterspell''' – Only counters spells from the arcana listed.%0a%0aDeath%0a%0a'''Control Ghost''' (Death 3, MtA p. 138)%0a%0aThis spell is incorrectly listed as Vulgar. It is Covert.%0a%0a'''Destroy Object''' (Death 3, MtA p. 139)%0a%0aThis spell is incorrectly listed as Covert. It is Vulgar.%0a%0a'''Slay Own Aura''' (Death 4, MtA p. 144)%0a%0aThis spell is incorrectly listed as being Death 5. It is a Death 4 spell.%0aMind%0a%0a'''Emotional Urging''' (Mind 2, MtA p. 207)%0a%0aFor clarification, Emotional Urging does not allow the caster to dictate the subject's actions; merely how the subject feels about something in a very general sense. Casting Emotional Urging on someone to make them angry at the sight of their roommate does NOT mean that the affected character will react in any other way than they normally would when angry. Some people will become passive aggressive and stew quietly. Others will start a shouting match. Only a few people will actually become violent. The spell does not in any way allow the caster to dictate the target’s physical response to a stimuli, only how they feel about something in a very broad sense.%0a%0a'''Eternal Now''' %0a%0aMust be cast before events take place because it stops the formation of new memories. It does not go back and erase the past.%0aImposter – does not grant social merits when mimicking someone else ( IE Striking looks or similar merits)%0a%0a'''Incognito Presence''' (Mind 2, MtA p. 208)%0a%0aAs a reminder, lest some forget, Incognito Presence does not equal invisibility. It simply makes the caster unremarkable and easily dismissed for the duration or until the caster does something to blatantly call attention to themselves. For the record, walking down the street caked in blood with a knife in hand is blatantly attention-grabbing. Y'know, just saying.%0a%0a'''Mind Armor (Mental Shield''', Mind 2, MtA p. 208 and '''Misperception, Mind 2''', MtA p. 209)%0a%0aThe Mind arcana is noteworthy in that it has two different Shielding spells at Mind 2: Mental Shield and Misperception. As the term “(Arcana) Armor” is often used in place of the actual spell name (like Matter Armor, Fate Armor, etc), it is important to distinguish exactly which “Mind Armor” one is referring to when using it and to understand that they are two separate spells. Mental Shield erects a barrier within the caster's mind, making it more difficult for others to read his thoughts, alter his behavior, or launch mental attacks through the Mind arcana or similar mental powers. Misperception provides physical Armor from attacks by toying with the perceptions of onlookers, causing them to misread their target’s position when attacking.%0aImposter – does not grant social merits when mimicking someone else ( IE Striking looks or similar merits)%0a%0a'''Diplomat's Protection''' (Mind 3, SL p. 200)%0a%0aAs written, the points of Armor gained from this spell is equal to the spell's Potency. Along with the other benefits of the spell, a ritual casting of Diplomat’s Protection more or less makes every other Armor-buffing Shielding spell in the game obsolete. To mitigate this, the points of Armor one can gain from Diplomat’s Protection have been capped at the caster’s Mind rating, bringing its Armor bonus in line with other Shielding spells. Otherwise the spell functions as written.%0a%0a'''Psychic Projection''' (Mind 4, MtA p. 215)%0a%0aWe are using the Mind’s Eye Theatre version of Psychic Projection, which functions exactly as the Core book with the exception that the mage is not able to affect the material world around her Twilight-projected consciousness via magic. A mage using Psychic Projection may use their magic on other Twilight beings normally, but lacks the ability to affect the physical world while in that state, even with magic.%0a%0aApologies to all those with Mind 4 Untouchable Unseen Assassin concepts; we're about to do it again.%0a%0aPrime%0a%0a'''Spell Cloak''' (Prime 2, TotM p. 70)%0a%0aSpell Cloak is an Advanced Spell Factor (like Sympathetic Spells and Prepared Spells) that was intended for inclusion in the Mage core book, but was overlooked in editing (along with fixing Imbue Item and making sure that the Paradox rules weren’t split up into two sections 144 pages apart). It was finally included in Tome of the Mysteries. Unfortunately its entry contained some contradictory typos and some confusing language, the book has been out of print for quite some time, and to top it all off bad word of mouth has attributed capabilities to Spell Cloak that it simply doesn’t have, so here is a clarified version for your convenience.%0a                   %0aSpell Cloak (Prime •• + conjunctional Arcanum)%0a%0aCost: 1 Mana%0a%0aA mage with Prime 2 can add a cloaking effect to his spells when he casts them, making them invisible to a mage’s Unseen Senses and making it harder for those with active Mage Sight to notice the spell. He spends one Mana upon casting (in addition to any other Mana required for the spell).%0a%0aA cloaked spell does not register (or “ping” in OOC vernacular) to a mage's Unseen Senses (Mage The Awakening, p. 110), and thus does not alert nearby mages or other characters with Unseen Senses (such as sleepwalkers) to the fact that anything out of the ordinary is happening.%0a%0aA cloaked spell might still register to another character's Unseen Senses if that character has a form of Mage Sight active while the cloaked spell is active. In the case of Instant or Reflexive action cloaked spells that have immediate Lasting effects (such as the Mind 3 spell 'Psychic Assault,' and most other attack spells), a character's Mage Sight must be active during the actual casting of the cloaked spell. For cloaked spells that have transitory or even prolonged effects (such as the Space 2 spell 'Ward'), a character may activate Mage Sight after the spell has been cast and have a chance to detect its presence via Unseen Senses, just as long as the cloaked spell is still active and in their presence. The roll for a character with active Mage Sight to detect a cloaked spell effect via Unseen Senses is Wits + Occult with a penalty equal to the Potency of the cloaked spell. This is a reflexive action on the part of the character making the detection roll.%0a%0aIf a character has reason to believe there is a cloaked spell nearby, or is searching the area for supernatural clues anyway, he can see through the spell cloak by exceeding twice its Potency with his scrutiny successes. After this has been accomplished, the character may scrutinize the spell as per the normal scrutiny rules (Mage The Awakening, p. 277-280).%0a%0aIt is important to note that while this technique cloaks the spell's presence to others' Unseen Senses, it does NOT in any way conceal the caster's nimbus effect if the cloaked spell is Vulgar, nor does it change a spell's aspect from Vulgar to Covert.%0a%0a'''Imbue Item''' (Prime 3, MtA p. 225)%0a%0a'''See House Rule Regarding Imbue Item'''%0a%0a'''Payment in Power''' (Prime 3, TotM p. 129)%0a%0aPayment in power will not be used in the venue because Mana is far too temporary and attainable a resource to substitute for the cost of relinquishing a permanent spell. Therefore Payment in Power will not be allowed.%0a%0aSpace%0a%0a'''Ward''' (Space 2, MtA p. 236)%0a%0aIt is important to note that Ward effectively locks the spatial template of the affected area, rendering it difficult to cast ANY spell that tampers with Space into, out of, or within its confines. This includes Space-based spells performed by the Ward's creator. Keep this in mind when designing your own Sanctum's defenses; being able to Teleport doesn't help if you're cornered in a room with a Ward potency of 15. As per the Spell Control rules on p 128, a mage may take an Instant Action to modify an existing spell in her control to exclude themselves and/or others. In the case of Ward, exempting a target enables that character to freely cast Space magic within, into, or out of its confines...as well as no longer being under the aegis of the Ward’s protection from Space magic, even while standing within the Warded area.%0a%0a'''Sympathetic Magic''' (Space 2, MtA p. 114-116)%0a%0aOnce a mage becomes an Apprentice of Space, they have begun on the path to understanding the penultimate truth that distance is a mere illusion. As the first step on the path to achieving that state, the mage learns to extend his senses beyond his mundane reach, able to scry upon distant locations and affect targets with his magic at an extreme distance.%0a%0aSympathetic casting at its strongest operates on the principle of like affects like. Since distance is meaningless, if you have a piece of a person - whether it’s hair, blood, etc. - affecting the piece of them that you have with magic is just as good as affecting the person themselves. Alternatively, a mage can rely on their own intimate knowledge of the target, but this kind of sympathetic connection is less flexible and can cut both ways.%0a%0aThe advantage (or in some cases disadvantage) of physical connections to a target like blood and hair is that the sample can be used by anyone with sufficient Space to sympathetically affect the target. A more intimate conceptual/emotional connection between oneself and the target cannot be used by a third party to affect either target, but generally speaking if a caster can claim such a connection to the target, the target can claim such a connection right back for the purposes of their own spells. This could be useful if the other mage is an ally, or a hindrance if the other mage is actually planning to betray you.%0a%0aThere are two categories of physical substances when speaking in terms of living targets; Greater and Lesser pieces. Greater pieces are things like hair, nail clippings, blood, teeth, or bits of flesh. Lesser pieces are things like sweat, oil, or urine. The general guidelines for determining whether a sample is a Greater or Lesser piece can be settled by a couple of questions. First, is the piece something that was meant to be expelled from the body? If yes, then it is a Lesser piece. If not, proceed to the second question; did it require conscious effort on the part of someone to remove it from the target? If yes, then it is a Greater piece.%0a%0aSo for example, blood would always be a Greater piece, since it is generally not supposed to be anywhere other than in a person’s veins, and the only way to get it out is to deliberately wound oneself or another. A dead leaf that has fallen from a tree, however, would be a Lesser piece.%0a%0aFurthermore, in the case of biological samples taken from still-living beings, samples WILL eventually rot away physically (and over the course of the process lose their sympathetic connection as the state of the sample moves further and further away from that of the still-living target). If the ST determines that the sample is one that will degrade, assume that if no preventative measures are taken, biological samples will degrade one step on the Sympathy chart every two weeks until it has degraded down to Unknown, at which time the sample is useless for the purposes of sympathetically casting against the target.%0a%0aSympathetically targeting a location for the purposes of scrying works in much the same way. Having a piece of the location’s physical substance is a great way to achieve a strong sympathetic link, while more conceptual ties require more intimate knowledge of the location.%0a%0a'''Ban''' (Space 3, MtA p. 237)%0a%0aThis spell, while good conceptually, is sadly mechanically vague. To clarify, replace the second and third paragraphs of the spell's text with the following:%0a%0aThe Ban must be cast in combination with the appropriate dot of the Arcanum governing a given phenomenon (say, Forces 2 for fire or Forces 5 for nuclear radiation). Thus, a mage with the right Arcanum knowledge could prevent insects (Life), metal objects (Matter), spirits (Spirit) or even people (Life) from intruding upon a given location. The subject of a Ban can be as general or specific as a mage wishes and ranging from "all energy" (meaning that the energy currently within the location remains there and no new energy can enter) to "thrown rocks" (meaning that rocks can be carried in, but those thrown at the space are repelled) to "Jerry's albino boa constrictor, Lucifer" (which keeps that one snake, and only that snake, out). The more inclusive a phenomenon is, the higher the penalty is to the spellcasting roll. "All energy" might impose a -3 penalty (and require Forces 5) while "Jerry's albino boa constrictor, Lucifer" might invoke no penalty (and require Life 2). Banning multiple phenomenon counts as a new Ban spell for each one (so, Bans against insects, metal objects and spirits require three different Ban spells unless the spells are cast together as a Combined Spell, per the normal combining spells rules).%0a%0aThe phenomenon must make an appropriate roll to enter a Banned area (if it doesn't already). A Banned person walking into the area may require Strength + Athletics while casting a spell into an area banned against magic would use the spell's rote pool (or Arcanum + Gnosis, whichever is appropriate; note that Space effects have to contend with the Ward in addition to relevant Bans). The successes of the roll or Potency of appropriate spells must exceed the Ban's Potency. Otherwise, the Ban holds – Banned people bounce off, and Banned spells fail within that area (although an area outside the Ban is affected by the spell normally). Each time one of the appropriate phenomena breaches the Ban, the phenomenon erodes the Ban's Potency by one point, reducing the Ban's efficacy. Note that phenomenon that can't make a test (such as an area over a river that has a Ban against water) simply fails to penetrate the Ban.%0a%0aSuccessive Ban spells add their excess Potency to the Ban (that is, any Potency in excess of the Ban's existing Potency), repairing any damage inflicted and perhaps even improving upon defenses. (The defending mage does not need to create a Ban all over again unless it has been destroyed). Reinforcing a Ban is an exception to the normal spell control rules.%0a%0aTime%0a%0a'''Augury''' (Time 2, MtA p. 258)%0a%0aAugury can be a useful spell, but unfortunately not everyone understands what it can and cannot do. Augury relies on Temporal Sympathy with the target of the spell to make a simple divination about the target’s future. A simple divination is a simple question that nets a general answer. ‘Yes or no’ questions are usually appropriate.%0a%0aSo for example, asking “Is the lottery ticket in my hand the winning ticket?” is valid, since you have the target in hand and you know when the drawing is going to be, giving you plenty of Temporal Sympathy to start with. The answer is also a simple ‘yes’ or ‘no.’ Asking “What are the winning lottery numbers this week going to be?” isn’t valid, since you have not only targeted something conceptual (random numbers to be determined at a later date), but have also asked for a specific result, which isn’t within the spell’s purview.%0a%0a[--%25color=#365776%25[[#top| Back to top]]--]%0a%0a%0a[[#TC]]%0a!!Territory%0a%0aTerritory:%0a	%0aFirst off, you do not need to be in a cabal to request territory. An individual mage may reques this of the Consilium. Some Mages, with a certain degree of clout, can request personal domains, personal territory, that they are responsible for. Until people reach this level of clout then they need to be in a cabal, as this is the easiest way to request territory. Realize, when you request territory you will be expected to “Police” it. It’s your yard, you need to take responsibility for it. Keep that in mind when you request territory. For example, if you request an area with a high Seers influence you may be expected to take the war to their door.%0a%0aYou can ask for territory, personal or cabal and the Council of the Consilium can approve it. (It is good to know people.) They may approve your request, they may approve some of your request, and they may deny your request, some or all of it. My suggestion is that you think your territory request through, keep it reasonable. The Council is under no obligation to give a Mage who asks for 5 blocks to be their territory all 5 blocks at the same time, they may offer a cabal with a long service history to the Consilium more territory than requested. Territory is not a one-way street, once you have a certain area you are responsible for that area, you will have to have some form of presence or awareness. If bad things happen in your back yard you will be the first to be asked WTF?%0a%0a	%0aTerritories do not include major arteries of transportation.  Road and waterways are considered free passage. If you are on the interstate, and it crosses a territory, don’t get off at that exit. Go on to the next one and then head where you are going. If there are major businesses, clubs, gathering points in a territory then these will be considered neutral ground. There is no need to tell a cabal that you are going to get your dance on, but, should you do something to attract attention in that area while enjoying the neutral ground, you may be called on your actions and perhaps banned from an area. While you are on the major routes (and we are talking; highways, state roads, main streets and the like) you are not busting into someone’s territory. If you go sightseeing into a cabal’s territory by tooling around their barrio, then you either ask permission, or you hope you do not get caught.%0a%0aNOTE: (THIS IS IMPORTANT)%0a%0aLet’s say you have a sanctum and you want to remain all secret and sneaky like. Ok, that’s cool I can dig that for a Mage. But! When a cabal gets formed and requests territory, and that territory just happens to have your hidden sanctum in the middle of it, it is now up to you to work it out IC with them. There will be no “Oh I meant to ask for that area.” being done after the fact. You need to get in front of the council and ask, or if a cabal moves in and they find you, they have the right to evict you. They can charge you rent in tass, or something else, and you either need to fork it over or you need to move. KEEP THIS IN MIND! If not, you need to hide, and that is where it gets interesting.%0a%0a[--%25color=#365776%25[[#top| Back to top]]--]%0a

I seem to be micromanaging Mage; you may even think I will tell you how to play the game. %0a%3c %0a%3c This thought could not be more wrong. %0a%3c %0a%3c Some of you might go,“ WTF Hunter, wai you do this?” And the reason is simple. When you play in a table top game you can set the pace of the story with your ST, you can push the envelope because you know at a set time any given week that you will be rocking the dice and getting your supernal swerve on. These games are regular, you know the people you play with outside of the table, you know how they play, how they react, hell you might even be friends with some of them.%0a%3c %0a%3c On an online platform you no longer have this luxury. You have to play with people located all over the world, in different countries and different time zones. Instead of those three or four people who interpret the rules like you do you now have to play with dozens of different styles and different opinions on how the game is played, much less run. This is where I come in.%0a%3c %0a%3c Most of what I type doesn’t change the core game. Yes there are some exceptions made, but for the most part I look to simplify things instead of making them more complex. What I am doing is establishing a level playing field. What is expected of you is the same that is expected of everyone else. The same legitimization for; experience, for status, for shiniez of all shapes and sizes now applies to everyone. These are expectations that you can hold one another accountable to, and more importantly, you can hold me accountable as well. %0a%3c %0a%3c I have been on Wanton for a while and there have always been grey areas that are left open to interpretation. Often times the fights on these interpretations have caused bad blood between players, between the storytellers, and even the administration. I am going to burn as much of that bad blood out before it becomes a problem. Is there a lot to take in, damn right there is, but you all are gamers, you know how to read and how to roll with the punches. If I didn’t think it would have worth I would not write it, so understand this is a commitment by me to you all, and not some massive grab to pigeon-hole the game. If anything, it sets the stage for more creativity because you know what to expect. You have all the information that takes the “what if’ out of dealing with someone you don’t know.

Outside of the orders, mages band together to form working groups with a shared interest. Because of this, and with the proposal that Troy has crafted based on his interpretation of the Revelations MUX, here is expectation of the work done on cabals. Before you read the next part I will let you know that cabals will have their own locked threads in which members can access.%0a%3c %0a%3c Introduction%0a%3c The creation of a cabal is an example of an Iron Law (Silver Ladder, p. 73). The act of swearing an Iron oath infuses the mages’ words with power.%0a%3c %0a%3c A cabal’s formation establishes a mystical connection between different mages, a bond based on specific principles that echo in the Supernal Realms. The cabal’s power draws from the nature of its members: their beliefs, values, Path, Order, Legacy, worldview, and even their conflicts. They cannot withhold what makes them Awakened, and strange confluences sometimes occur.%0a%3c %0a%3c Mages contribute something of themselves when they perform the ritual of cabalization, just as though they cast a spell. The members must share a core understanding of the cabal before they can even begin to attune themselves to one another. This corresponds to the imago of a spell; without seeing what they want to create, they cannot invest it with power. Specific symbols and imagery associated with their core credo establish anchorages in the Fallen World, and define the nature of the cabal. Only then can the latent power in the Supernal flow through to make the metaphysical bonds.%0a%3c %0a%3c The Mystery revealed during the ritual resonates with power and significance, often revealed in flickers of vision, a shared understanding, and subtle signs for days and weeks after the cabal is formed. The Mystery cements the connection that holds Supernal resonance. %0a%3c %0a%3c Joining a Cabal%0a%3c At least three Wise are required to form a cabal. Mages join a cabal by performing a lengthy ceremony in a location associated with magic, like a hallow, a mountain peak or a tower, or a caucus building. They prepare symbols corresponding to the cabal's foundation theme and draw Supernal glyphs and swear the oath to one another to create a cabal. Each participant spends one point of Willpower and a point of Mana, then enters into communal meditation and visions lasting 16 hours.%0a%3c %0a%3c When a mage seeks to enter an existing cabal, any member can perform the cabal ritual with him. %0a%3c %0a%3c Theme%0a%3c Decide your theme, the unifying theme, myth or motif for the cabal and its members. Themes can be founded upon nearly anything, but the cabal’s must hold mystical, spiritual, or symbolic significance for its members.%0a%3c %0a%3c Purpose%0a%3c The Purpose is the foundation for the cabal based on a particular set of beliefs. By nature, the Purpose is selective rather than all-encompassing. All participants contribute to the creation of these laws, even if they may not be consciously aware of the role. Purpose is a tool to designate what a cabal is about.%0a%3c %0a%3c Three maximum purposes branching off of this indicate what the cabal’s goals and interests are. They are frequently related to one another, and an offshoot of mutual Path or Order goals.%0a%3c •	Above: A goal rooted in the Supernal Realms. A focus or a goal rooted in Awakened society. %0a%3c •	Below: A goal pursued in the Fallen World. A ban or an aim directed at Sleepers. %0a%3c •	Ascension: A long term, ultimate goal. %0a%3c %0a%3c Category%0a%3c Determine the primary ideal uniting a cabal and driving their actions.%0a%3c •	Allegiance: The cabal serves an area or a specific entity (spirit, Order, etc.). %0a%3c •	Endeavor: The cabal is driven by a shared, epic endeavor. %0a%3c •	Principle: The cabal serves an ideology or a philosophy. %0a%3c •	Questing: The cabal aims to complete a particular task. %0a%3c %0a%3c Benefits%0a%3c Specific benefits are determined by the cabal's Purpose. Benefits are selected at time of cabal creation and cannot be changed. If a new member joins the cabal, her dot for "Above" bonus can apply to an existing or a new Merit.%0a%3c •	Above: Each member contributes one dot to a shared cabal Merit pool. Dots may be split among multiple Merits or applied to a single Merit. Common choices include Social merits and Sanctum-related merits, such as Alchemical Lab and Library. %0a%3c •	Below: +1 to mundane, non-spellcasting rolls with a selected Skill. %0a%3c •	Ascension: Reroll failed dice on Wisdom degeneration checks when adhering to her cabal ethos. Violating the ethos is a Wisdom 3 sin. If it would be a Wisdom 1 or 2 sin, take a -2 penalty to avoid degeneration. %0a%3c •	Aura: Scarlet bands for oathbinding are visible on the mage's aura.%0a%3c %0a%3c Leaving a Cabal%0a%3c To leave an existing cabal, a mage declares her departure and breaks a symbol associated with the cabal's theme. A mage who departs with the blessing of the other cabal members suffers the following penalties:%0a%3c •	1 point of Willpower is immediately lost.%0a%3c •	All benefits are lost.%0a%3c •	Aura returns to normal.%0a%3c •	The cabal loses the Merit dot contributed by the member leaving. %0a%3c %0a%3c A mage violates the Iron Law by breaking a cabal oath, departing on poor terms or joining another cabal without properly leaving the first. The Diamond Orders see the failure to live up to the Iron Law as a sign of immaturity, untrustworthiness, and irresponsibility. Oathbreaking among the Adamantine Arrow is a serious matter which warrants immediate response, ranging from reprisals to death for the most grievous offenses. A Talon's word is their magic, a sacred trust never to be broken.%0a%3c %0a%3c An oathbreaker suffers the following penalties:%0a%3c •	1 dot of Willpower is immediately lost.%0a%3c •	All benefits are lost.%0a%3c •	Aura returns to normal.%0a%3c •	-1 to all non-magical Social rolls with other mages for one season.%0a%3c %0a%3c An Example%0a%3c The A-Team are a cabal dedicated to battling the corrupt influence of the Seers of the Throne, Scelesti, and even mortal authorities or other supernatural entities that weigh down the souls of Sleepers. Their theme is that they are a group mercenary renegade soldiers who specialize in infiltration, surveillance, counter-intelligence, and, of course, physical confrontation. If you have a problem, and if you can find them, maybe you can hire -- The A-Team. Their Shadownames are: Hannibal, Face, BA, Howling Mad Murdock, and Amy.%0a%3c Theme: Righteous Soldiers of Fortune%0a%3c Purpose:%0a%3c o	Above: To counter and destroy the influence, assets, and machinations of the Seers of the Throne.%0a%3c o	Below: To protect Sleepers preyed upon by corrupt individuals, be they Awakened or sleeper, or something in-between.%0a%3c o	Ascension: To preserve and uphold Justice and Freedom for all of humanity.%0a%3c Category: Endeavor%0a%3c Members:%0a%3c o	Doorwarden: BA%0a%3c Hearthmaster: Hannibal%0a%3c Farseeker: Face%0a%3c Lorekeeper: Amy%0a%3c Benefits:%0a%3c •	Above: +2 Contacts (Media, Criminal Underground), +2 Resources%0a%3c •	Below: +1 to Subterfuge rolls%0a%3c %0a%3c With the information provided above you have an idea of how to create a cabal and word it. Copy pasta the above work and then fit your characters into the template as they are needed.%0a%3c We are going to address the titles used in regards to cabal’s and sanctums. Since everyone has not gone and purchased Sanctum & Sigil, we are going to post some of the information here for you.%0a%3c %0a%3c %0a%3c First off, the titles and what they roughly translate into:%0a%3c %0a%3c Farseeker: Scrounger, fixer, this is the person who finds needed resources for the cabal.%0a%3c %0a%3c Doorwarden: Bouncer, strong arm. Typically the defender of the sanctum or cabal.%0a%3c %0a%3c Hearthmaster: Tender of the sanctum, also used as the head of the Sanctum or Cabal.%0a%3c %0a%3c Lorekeeper: Another title used as the head of sanctum, but in charge of keeping the     history.%0a%3c %0a%3c Edgetender: In charge of the mystical resources (tender of the Hallow if you have one.%0a%3c %0a%3c Now the rights: %0a%3c %0a%3c [[#Lex-5]]%0a%3c !!The Great Rights   %0a%3c %0a%3c (Click on the link for an expanded version of the great rights)%0a%3c %0a%3c Right of Crossing: Let no borders stop an Awakened with a clear heart.(How you let people in and across your boarders. Rules for travel.)%0a%3c %0a%3c Right of Emeritus: Those who have earned respect must be treated with respect.(How to treat guests, and how guests are supposed to act. This can get dicey at times.)%0a%3c %0a%3c Right of Hospitality: Those who request hospitality must be granted it.(How to ask for protection, but this can be revoked due to screwing up Emeritus)%0a%3c %0a%3c Right of Nemesis: When vengeance is declared, let none stand in its way.(How to declare war, the right of whoop ass)%0a%3c 	%0a%3c Right of Sanctuary: Protect your home, and let no action cause it harm.(The ability to defend what is yours how you see fit.)%0a%3c %0a%3c Now, for a personal sanctum you still can enforce the rights, but it should be a recognized sanctum. Obviously you don’t need all the fancy titles to be displayed because you already wear too many hats. Personal sanctums and personal territory can be approved by the council.%0a%3c %0a%3c (Much of this was suggested by TroyR and was taken directly from one of his posts)%0a%3c %0a%3c [--%25color=#365776%25[[#top| Back to top]]--]%0a%3c %0a%3c [[#MC]]%0a%3c !!Merits%0a%3c %0a%3c Merit Clarification:%0a%3c %0a%3c No Merits from Bannishers, Seers of the Throne, or any “Antagonist” supplements are allowed at this time.%0a%3c Generalized Merits:%0a%3c %0a%3c Allies – Allies also have the ability to call on a player to perform favors%0a%3c Artifact – Not allowed at creation%0a%3c Contacts – Similar to allies, but they do not always have the answers players are looking for%0a%3c Eidetic Memory – Is not an automatic success, it is +2 to Int+ Comp to remember%0a%3c Encyclopedic Knowledge – can be general but the information remembered will be just that, generalized in regards to obscure facts and information; or you can have a focus area for an actual roll.%0a%3c Fame – Fame 1 – Local, Fame 2 – Regional, Fame 3 national (potentially a fame 4 as international)%0a%3c Familiar – Requires appropriate level of Arcana to summon or “Employ”%0a%3c Resources – represent available cash after bills. %0a%3c Status – See different area on status%0a%3c Sanctum Guardians – Require appropriate arcana before they can be summoned or “employ”%0a%3c %0a%3c Other Merits%0a%3c EOD (Arm p. 208)%0a%3c Explosive Ordnance Disposal, as per the official White Wolf errata, is a 2 dot Merit, not 4.%0a%3c %0a%3c Emotional Detachment (Asy p. 50)%0a%3c Emotional detachment allows you to ignore stress penalties up to your resolve. It is not a catch all stone-cold-killer merit that means that you are unreadable and do not display feelings. There is no negative modifier that affect others if they are checking your aura or body language.  %0a%3c %0a%3c %0a%3c %0a%3c %0a%3c Entheogenic Synesthesia (MT. p. 137)%0a%3c This merit allows a +1 to perception while using psychoactive drugs. However, the use of psychoactive pharmaceuticals has its own set of negative modifiers that will be in play during their use. %0a%3c %0a%3c Feral Mein (TotW p. 154)%0a%3c An oft-used, and not-used-well Merit is Feral Mein. The character moves and/or talks in a way that is very primal and fascinating to onlookers. Specifically it can give bonus dice to seduce or scare. This bonus however may disappear if circumstances dictate such. If the character makes use of this merit frequently but fails to achieve a reputation for actually having some bite behind their bark, they might no longer gain the benefits of this merit. If another character can justifiably peg the user as being “all bark and no bite,” or “a tease,” then the character possessing this merit may no longer gain the +3 bonus against that defender, as the defender doesn't buy the image.%0a%3c %0a%3c If this undesired reputation spreads to enough people, the character may lose the benefits of the merit altogether; their reputation precedes them, and unless corrected, others may be able to ignore the character’s Feral Mein for what it truly is...just an act.%0a%3c %0a%3c This Merit, like Predator's Innocence, must be well-justified in the character background and the player must also be prepared to describe during sanctioning how they intend to portray their character's animalistic behavior.%0a%3c %0a%3c Fighting Style: Adamantine Hand (AA p. 53)%0a%3c One of the prerequisites for this Fighting Style is to have five dots of Fighting Style merits, with at least one style at 3 dots or higher. These five Fighting Style dots must come from Brawl or Weaponry-based styles, as Adamantine Hand is a Brawl and Weaponry-based style. Adamantine Hand has been taught since the inception of the order and possibly earlier, well before the development of firearms. Sorry shootists, but Adamantine Hand is an anachronistic teaching that does not make use of modern tech.%0a%3c %0a%3c Fighting Style: Fencing (Arm p. 211)%0a%3c As per the official White Wolf errata, the Riposte maneuver (3 dots) costs a Willpower point, which the player must spend as soon as he decides his character will apply twice his Defense to an incoming enemy attack.%0a%3c %0a%3c Fighting Style: Improvised Weaponry (MR p. 57)%0a%3c Due to an absurd interaction between the three dot maneuver (Breaking Point) and the Matter 3 spell Alter Integrity that was apparently overlooked by the merit's writer, Breaking Point now has the following limitation: the attacker may exchange no more points of Structure in a single attack than they have dots in Strength.%0a%3c %0a%3c This to prevent exploitation of a mechanical loophole involving the use of Alter Integrity (to increase the Durability, and subsequently, the Structure of objects) in combination with this maneuver to create a single-use weapon with an absurdly high equipment bonus. This runs completely counter to the very concept of Alter Integrity, which is to make an object harder to break, which also runs counter to the intended display of Breaking Point, which is to break an object over the enemy. It’s also just not good game sense.%0a%3c %0a%3c Fighting Style: Staff (Arm p. 214)%0a%3c As per the official White Wolf errata, the Dangerous Radius maneuver (3 dots) costs a Willpower point, which the player must spend before making any attack rolls.%0a%3c %0a%3c Good Time Management: (Asy. 50, Rel. 84) %0a%3c Cannot be used in conjunction with casting spells, especially extended casting spells. This would include working on imbued items or the creation of items when using arcana (inscribe grimoire etc.)%0a%3c Imbued Item (MtA p. 84)%0a%3c See Imbued Item House Rule%0a%3c %0a%3c Language (WoD p. 109)%0a%3c As per the official White Wolf errata, Language is a 1 dot merit rather than a 1 to 3 dot merit.%0a%3c %0a%3c Multi-lingual (Rel p. 85)%0a%3c It must be stressed that the languages granted by this merit only makes the character conversant in those (2) languages (per Dot;) that means they can speak it passably, but anything too fast or convoluted is going to give them trouble (as reflected in the rolls outlined in the merit) and reading or writing ANYTHING in the language requires a roll.%0a%3c %0a%3c Occultation (MtA p. 86)%0a%3c As a reminder, this merit is completely incompatible with Fame; having one precludes your character from having the other. Furthermore, the benefits of Occultation can partly or even completely go away once the mage involves himself in Sleeper society, especially if the mage has attracted the attention of the mundane world (which can be something as simple as using Striking Looks to get a free drink at a bar to something as gross as robbing a bank with no mask and thus becoming the target of an FBI manhunt). This effectively makes it impossible for a mage to maintain any degree of Occultation and cultivate relationships with Sleepers at the same time.%0a%3c %0a%3c The benefits of the merit return once Sleeper society has effectively forgotten the mage, which, depending on how entangled the mage has become in Sleeper affairs, could be anywhere from weeks, to years, or even decades.%0a%3c %0a%3c Predator's Innocence (TotW p. 154)%0a%3c A common misconception is that this Merit gives a character license to murder whenever he wants without making Wisdom rolls. Some take this a step further and think that possessing this Merit means their character is some kind of zen wolf-man who is unconcerned with human morality. These beliefs are not only incorrect, they are also rather silly.%0a%3c %0a%3c The idea that mages are still human at their core is an essential part of the game. The Awakening does not radically alter a mage’s mind into something alien. Over time, a Master (likely a Thyrsus) with high enough Gnosis might have become crazy enough to start behaving in a way that is inconsistent with normal human behavior, but that's precisely what that kind of behavior is; madness. Predator's Innocence does not equal sociopathic tendencies with no repercussions. The key part of the Merit's text reads: “If the mage shows particular malice, if she tortures the subject before killing him or if she kills for morally questionable reasons, then the Storyteller might rule that a degeneration check is necessary.”%0a%3c %0a%3c Thus, murdering someone for being “in my territory,” “challenging my dominance,” or “invading my personal space” are not behaviors that are protected by Predator's Innocence. Once again, self-defense, no other recourse, fight/flight killings are applicable. Walking up to a downed and unconscious person and putting a bullet in their head is not.%0a%3c %0a%3c This Merit, like Feral Mein, must be well-justified in the character background and the player must be prepared to describe during sanctioning how they intend to portray the Merit.%0a%3c %0a%3c Sanctum (MtA p. 86)%0a%3c See Sanctum write up.%0a%3c %0a%3c Striking Looks (WoD p. 117)%0a%3c A large number of chat players like to take Striking Looks at varying degrees, creating venues chock full of beautiful people. Without going into how unlikely it is for this to be the case, possessing the Striking Looks merit CAN be a hindrance. People with it are more likely to be stalked. People with it who commit crimes are more likely to be remembered and identified (the Striking Looks bonus becomes a bonus for the witness). So beware of this fact before you decide to have your Striking Looks 4 character raid a rival's sanctum in broad daylight whilst wearing a dress that emphasizes her subtle curves and absolutely no facial concealment.%0a%3c %0a%3c Also! Even if your character does not have the Striking Looks merit, but can be commonly seen hanging out with a character who does, your character may be subject to a similar situational (albeit reduced) bonus when it comes to other people remembering your character or picking you out of a lineup. The more distinguishing marks your character has, the worse it is.%0a%3c %0a%3c Trained Observer (DoW p. 38)%0a%3c This merit appeared in a book centered around military characters. It unfortunately has little in the way of concept text, thus leaving it up to us to divine its intent. We believe that the merit was intended to represent characters who have had practice at shutting out stressful outside distractions while observing their environment, like being able to notice an incoming flanking attack while under fire from machine guns and mortar, for example. Some law enforcement types are indeed able to do this, though it is important to remind everyone that this merit only relieves penalties for physical observation of one's environment. It gives absolutely no insight into intent or motive.%0a%3c %0a%3c Also, regarding the three dot version of this merit, see the addendum regarding Rote Actions (link).%0a%3c %0a%3c Rote Actions (WoD p. 134)%0a%3c Rote Actions are a system permutation that represent a character who either has detailed instructions to follow, or in some cases acts on muscle memory. It allows the character one reroll of any dice that came up on the initial roll as failures. This can be a potent mechanic, and there are several ways of achieving it. Some high-cost Merits grant it, but mages in particular have very easy access to some spells that can grant the ability.%0a%3c %0a%3c In order to counterbalance the relatively common availability of this ability in the context of a Mage game, any Rote Action used - whether the action associated with it is Reflexive, Instant, or Extended, whether granted from magic or mundane ability - denies the user her Defense bonus for that turn. She focused on either following detailed instructions or following muscle memory. The outside world temporarily fades into the background for them while they carry out their action with zen-like efficiency, which unfortunately leaves them more open to a firm smack in the head.%0a%3c %0a%3c In combat situations, this precludes the combining of Rote Actions and certain combat maneuvers, specifically ones that require the user to sacrifice their Defense for the turn. A character could not, for example, use a spell to perform a Rote action Weaponry attack AND declare the attack as All-out.%0a%3c %0a%3c [--%25color=#365776%25[[#top| Back to top]]--]%0a%3c %0a%3c %0a%3c [[#SC]]%0a%3c !!Sanctums%0a%3c %0a%3c Sanctums:%0a%3c %0a%3c Like other supplements, not everyone will have access to a copy of Sanctum and Sigil. It is a good resource, as many of the books are, and there are aspects of the book that people will want to use. One of these aspects is the time spent on sanctums themselves. These are the abodes of the Awakened, the protective walls to hide the wonders of the ancients from the eyes of the sleeping world. %0a%3c %0a%3c The idea is that a sanctum is a personal reflection of a mage, this is not so much home as it is a place of meditation, study, practice and power. You, as the player, can dress it up in whatever style you want, describing it in great or little detail, but you need to consider your character, as an Awakened mage practices away from prying eyes. Also, it is hard to claim territory as a singular mage, or as a cabal, without some form of established “base” (if you will) to operate from. %0a%3c %0a%3c This said, the Sanctum, for singular mages or for cabals, as it is written in Sanctum and Sigil, is a sinkhole for merit points. It could bankrupt you if you were to follow its structure point for point. In the core, Sanctum is undefined. Sanctum in the core is pretty much a breakdown of size, and size in the core book gets a little ridiculous to be honest. You go from 1 dot (a 2 bedroom apartment) to 5 dot (Versailles.) This is just a little nuts, ok, maybe medium nuts. Sanctum and Sigil go the opposite route; you now have to spend dots of /everything./ By everything I mean locks, doors, windows, a garden gnome, exterior walls, interior walls and accent lighting. And this doesn’t even take into account things like wards, bans, ghosts, spirits or a cat.%0a%3c %0a%3c %0a%3c What I want to see is this:%0a%3c %0a%3c 1)	You must clearly define in your thread what your sanctum entails. Is it an entire apartment or one room? Is it the entire floor of a building or just half?  Is it the entire warehouse or just a hidden part? Your sanctum size will be dictated then by what you ask for/define. Here are some considerations we will take into account%0a%3c a.	What are your resources? Can you afford the space? Can you afford the security?%0a%3c b.	Do you possess the magic to defend the area?%0a%3c c.	How much of this is habitable.%0a%3c %0a%3c 2)	When you start buying security we are splitting this down into 2 sections mundane and supernal.%0a%3c a.	Mundane security%0a%3c i.	Can you afford it%0a%3c ii.	What is it? %0a%3c iii.	Is it made to blend in or does it stick out%0a%3c iv.	Did you pay for the work or do it yourself%0a%3c %0a%3c Mundane security is where Sanctum and Sigil comes into play. See, I have some experience with Mages trying to get their B&E (That is breaking and entering for some of you out there) on, so defining a sanctum is actually important. So, to alleviate some of the point’s sink that is a sanctum here is how it will work. 1 dot in the sanctum merit will give you five points to spend across: size, exterior and interior construction, windows, locks, doors and security.  Yes, that is 7 categories and you only get 5 for the one dot. You have to decide what is the most important to you and then plan for the future. There will be ways to increase a sanctum’s various aspects.%0a%3c %0a%3c Also, let’s talk about cabals and sanctums. If you have a cabal of 4 people and each one spends 1 dot on a communal sanctum then you have 20 points to play with, which means you could make a pretty decent sanctum in size and defense.  The size and scope of the sanctum will also have an effect on what can be held inside the sanctum. A 3 dot alchemical laboratory won’t really fit inside a one dot sanctum… as an example.%0a%3c %0a%3c b.	Supernal Security%0a%3c i.	Wards and Bans%0a%3c ii.	Spirit Familiar%0a%3c iii.	Ghost Familiar%0a%3c iv.	Spell limitations%0a%3c %0a%3c You might be wondering why you are being asked for all this information. It would be nice for me, as a storyteller, to be able to back you when you say “player X tried to break in but I would know because I have A,B,C and D working for me.” By setting it up this way, I can back you and what you might know even if you were not there. This also works for spells, in theory this will stop players from saying “Oh I cast that a while ago and I just didn’t thread it.” We can place this on individual character sheets OR in Cabal threads so that it is in game and there is no question to what is going on. %0a%3c %0a%3c So, Supernal retainers/ guardians, etc.%0a%3c %0a%3c You have to be able to cast the spell to summon, bind, enter negotiations with spirits and ghosts to become retainers and guardians. Same goes for ward and ban. Realize, these spells have costs and some will count against your overall spell tolerance. Since there is no “price for power” alternative for relinquishing spells, to keep the spell up and not have it count against you there will be a willpower cost.%0a%3c %0a%3c Now, before someone asks:” If I do not have the right arcana does this mean I won’t be allowed Supernal defenses.” No, it means you have to find someone to do a favor for you, and you will have to find a way to pay them for their work. This can go for spirits, ghosts, wards and bans.So before you spend the points make sure your ducks are in a row. This doesn’t stop you from renting a mage to help you, but that is done IC and they have every right to charge you at the whazzoo for their services (just like a real contractor.)%0a%3c %0a%3c NOTE: (Part I) The Summoning of spirits and ghosts and BINDING/ Negotiating with them works like this. The level of the arcana in use will dictate how strong of a ghost or spirit you can summon. This may change in the future, but there will be no rank five spirits who just happily go along with a thyrsus with spirit 3. %0a%3c %0a%3c NOTE: (Part II) – The “hiring” or binding of a spirit or a ghost will require a scene. With something that is being developed, this is more important that you realize and has the potential to really impact you later.%0a%3c %0a%3c %0a%3c Reasoning for all of this:%0a%3c %0a%3c I try to utilize some logic regarding what can and cannot be done in the real world to the game. Yes, it is still Mage, it can be a game of wondrous creations. Sure a Moros with some matter can make a kick ass wall, but to make it permanent will cost them severely.  You can say “well I do this every day when I get up, but if you do not thread the roll, or log the mana spent then you have no proof, and proof is needed to defend your statements. The accountability will be shared by both the storyteller(s) and the players. As always, I am not against you, I am trying to make a fair playing field on which EVERY player can operate. Whether you are brand new or ten years in, doesn’t matter, same rules apply. Sure, cabal’s have a communal sanctum, but many mages could have private sanctums as well. You can try and blend the properties or you can keep them separate. You can request a ghost familiar, get a scene in with an ST, spend the points and you have it and there is a reason for you to have it. Nothing is for free, you spend the points, we do the scene everyone is, and you have what you came for. This way everything has a paper trail, everything is tracked, recorded and you have a venue that everyone stands on the same surface to begin with. What you do with it in the future, that will be up to you and your role-playing.%0a%3c %0a%3c [--%25color=#365776%25[[#top| Back to top]]--]%0a%3c %0a%3c %0a%3c [[#SCC]]%0a%3c !!Scrutiny%0a%3c %0a%3c It happens in almost every scene run. Something neat appears and then I get 4 or 5 posts of “I am scrutinizing this for 15 sux." The gun was just jumped, and so many times I want to send back “You get a rock." %0a%3c %0a%3c SO...let’s talk about the aspects of scrutiny:%0a%3c %0a%3c 1) Before you do this your mage sight has to be up.%0a%3c %0a%3c 2) You have to describe staring, focusing, paying direct attention to whatever you are scrutinizing BEFORE a roll is made and it must be a description posted in the main. NOW: If you are scrutinizing a person, you can try to do it on the down low but then the person gets a roll to notice you. IF, and I am making this call, If you try to scrutinize a person without them noticing, and you do not give them the option to roll (PC or NPC) then they automatically see you. There will be no " I forgot('s)." This begins with the first roll AND continues with all successive rolls. Bonus modifiers will go to the defender to notice as you sit there and creep them from across the room. There are no “scrutinize out of the corner of my eye" rolls.%0a%3c %0a%3c 3) In a moderated (Re:  ST driven) scene I will roll Int+Occ (with any modifiers) after you identify what you were looking for. There is no mass, “I have 20 sux I know everything,” rolls. They go one at a time. Scrutiny is when you are looking for something specific, you are focusing, and there is a goal in mind.%0a%3c %0a%3c Examples: %0a%3c Quote:%0a%3c • Identity: (1 success) Each resonance or aura is as unique as a fingerprint. If a mage has seen or studied a resonance before and is familiar with it, one success allows him to recognize the subject. He can recognize the resonance of the subject regardless of any sort of physical disguise or transformation, allowing him to detect people in disguise or underthe effects of a transformative spell. With five successes, he can recognize shapeshifters in any of their forms. There are some means of disguising a subject’s resonance (see below). Note that powerful mages have strong auras. Their Gnosis gives others a bonus to notice and scrutinize their resonance. See “Gnosis,” pp. 75-76.%0a%3c %0a%3c • Nature: (1 success) Resonance reveals a subject’s truenature: human or inhuman, mortal or spirit, Sleeper orAwakened. One success is enough to alert the mage that theperson is not what he seems to be, but the mage doesn’t necessarily know what the subject really is. Five successes allow a mage to determine a subject’s true nature. Among other things, this insight allows the Awakened to recognize each other through resonance, unless concealed in some%0a%3c way. Mages can also pick supernatural beings such as vampires or shapeshifters out of a group of ordinary mortals, although they might not be able to identify what they are, only that they aren’t normal. Pg 278 M:tA Core%0a%3c %0a%3c %0a%3c 4) Extending Rolling: The effects are not cumulative. I am not going to tell you about this person's childhood because you got trigger happy with the dice roller. It doesn't work like that. You tell me what you are looking for, I roll, I give you answers. You decide if that is enough or if there is more, you say what you want to look for and then you roll again. This is an aspect that would be obvious in table top. You roll, you ask the ST, they give you answers, you roll again. For some reason the FF button got hit here and we go right to the rolls. %0a%3c %0a%3c Flip side of this, there is no more rolling 30 sux on scrutiny and I tell you “It’s a rock." You don't flip out and think I am screwing with you. When you get “It’s a rock" on 2 Sux you would know to move on. When you get it on 30 you feel I am messing with you. Sometimes there just is not as much there as you want it and you wasted your time. Sometimes it is just a rock.%0a%3c %0a%3c Reread Pages 277- 280 please when you get a chance, it will help give better ideas on the love and hate of scrutiny.%0a%3c %0a%3c [--%25color=#365776%25[[#top| Back to top]]--]%0a%3c %0a%3c %0a%3c [[#SpC]]%0a%3c !!Spells%0a%3c %0a%3c Spell Clarifications:%0a%3c %0a%3c General:%0a%3c Counterspell – Only counters spells from the arcana listed.%0a%3c %0a%3c Death%0a%3c %0a%3c Control Ghost (Death 3, MtA p. 138)%0a%3c This spell is incorrectly listed as Vulgar.

It is a Death 4 spell.%0a%3c Mind%0a%3c %0a%3c Emotional Urging (Mind 2, MtA p. 207)%0a%3c For clarification, Emotional Urging does not allow the caster to dictate the subject's actions; merely how the subject feels about something in a very general sense. Casting Emotional Urging on someone to make them angry at the sight of their roommate does NOT mean that the affected character will react in any other way than they normally would when angry. Some people will become passive aggressive and stew quietly. Others will start a shouting match. Only a few people will actually become violent. The spell does not in any way allow the caster to dictate the target’s physical response to a stimuli, only how they feel about something in a very broad sense.%0a%3c %0a%3c Eternal Now ()%0a%3c Must be cast before events take place because it stops the formation of new memories. It does not go back and erase the past.%0a%3c Imposter – does not grant social merits when mimicking someone else ( IE Striking looks or similar merits)%0a%3c Incognito Presence (Mind 2, MtA p. 208)%0a%3c As a reminder, lest some forget, Incognito Presence does not equal invisibility. It simply makes the caster unremarkable and easily dismissed for the duration or until the caster does something to blatantly call attention to themselves. For the record, walking down the street caked in blood with a knife in hand is blatantly attention-grabbing. Y'know, just saying.%0a%3c %0a%3c Mind Armor (Mental Shield, Mind 2, MtA p. 208 and Misperception, Mind 2, MtA p. 209)%0a%3c The Mind arcana is noteworthy in that it has two different Shielding spells at Mind 2: Mental Shield and Misperception. As the term “(Arcana) Armor” is often used in place of the actual spell name (like Matter Armor, Fate Armor, etc), it is important to distinguish exactly which “Mind Armor” one is referring to when using it and to understand that they are two separate spells. Mental Shield erects a barrier within the caster's mind, making it more difficult for others to read his thoughts, alter his behavior, or launch mental attacks through the Mind arcana or similar mental powers. Misperception provides physical Armor from attacks by toying with the perceptions of onlookers, causing them to misread their target’s position when attacking.%0a%3c Imposter – does not grant social merits when mimicking someone else ( IE Striking looks or similar merits)%0a%3c Diplomat's Protection (Mind 3, SL p. 200)%0a%3c As written, the points of Armor gained from this spell is equal to the spell's Potency. Along with the other benefits of the spell, a ritual casting of Diplomat’s Protection more or less makes every other Armor-buffing Shielding spell in the game obsolete. To mitigate this, the points of Armor one can gain from Diplomat’s Protection have been capped at the caster’s Mind rating, bringing its Armor bonus in line with other Shielding spells. Otherwise the spell functions as written.%0a%3c %0a%3c Psychic Projection (Mind 4, MtA p. 215)%0a%3c We are using the Mind’s Eye Theatre version of Psychic Projection, which functions exactly as the Core book with the exception that the mage is not able to affect the material world around her Twilight-projected consciousness via magic. A mage using Psychic Projection may use their magic on other Twilight beings normally, but lacks the ability to affect the physical world while in that state, even with magic.%0a%3c %0a%3c Apologies to all those with Mind 4 Untouchable Unseen Assassin concepts; we're about to do it again.%0a%3c %0a%3c Prime%0a%3c %0a%3c Spell Cloak (Prime 2, TotM p. 70)%0a%3c Spell Cloak is an Advanced Spell Factor (like Sympathetic Spells and Prepared Spells) that was intended for inclusion in the Mage core book, but was overlooked in editing (along with fixing Imbue Item and making sure that the Paradox rules weren’t split up into two sections 144 pages apart). It was finally included in Tome of the Mysteries. Unfortunately its entry contained some contradictory typos and some confusing language, the book has been out of print for quite some time, and to top it all off bad word of mouth has attributed capabilities to Spell Cloak that it simply doesn’t have, so here is a clarified version for your convenience.%0a%3c                    %0a%3c Spell Cloak (Prime •• + conjunctional Arcanum)%0a%3c Cost: 1 Mana%0a%3c A mage with Prime 2 can add a cloaking effect to his spells when he casts them, making them invisible to a mage’s Unseen Senses and making it harder for those with active Mage Sight to notice the spell. He spends one Mana upon casting (in addition to any other Mana required for the spell).%0a%3c A cloaked spell does not register (or “ping” in OOC vernacular) to a mage's Unseen Senses (Mage The Awakening, p. 110), and thus does not alert nearby mages or other characters with Unseen Senses (such as sleepwalkers) to the fact that anything out of the ordinary is happening.%0a%3c A cloaked spell might still register to another character's Unseen Senses if that character has a form of Mage Sight active while the cloaked spell is active. In the case of Instant or Reflexive action cloaked spells that have immediate Lasting effects (such as the Mind 3 spell 'Psychic Assault,' and most other attack spells), a character's Mage Sight must be active during the actual casting of the cloaked spell. For cloaked spells that have transitory or even prolonged effects (such as the Space 2 spell 'Ward'), a character may activate Mage Sight after the spell has been cast and have a chance to detect its presence via Unseen Senses, just as long as the cloaked spell is still active and in their presence. The roll for a character with active Mage Sight to detect a cloaked spell effect via Unseen Senses is Wits + Occult with a penalty equal to the Potency of the cloaked spell. This is a reflexive action on the part of the character making the detection roll.%0a%3c If a character has reason to believe there is a cloaked spell nearby, or is searching the area for supernatural clues anyway, he can see through the spell cloak by exceeding twice its Potency with his scrutiny successes. After this has been accomplished, the character may scrutinize the spell as per the normal scrutiny rules (Mage The Awakening, p. 277-280).%0a%3c It is important to note that while this technique cloaks the spell's presence to others' Unseen Senses, it does NOT in any way conceal the caster's nimbus effect if the cloaked spell is Vulgar, nor does it change a spell's aspect from Vulgar to Covert.%0a%3c %0a%3c Imbue Item (Prime 3, MtA p. 225)%0a%3c See House Rule Regarding Imbue Item.%0a%3c %0a%3c Payment in Power (Prime 3, TotM p. 129)%0a%3c Payment in power will not be used in the venue because Mana is far too temporary and attainable a resource to substitute for the cost of relinquishing a permanent spell. Therefore Payment in Power will not be allowed.%0a%3c %0a%3c Space%0a%3c %0a%3c Ward (Space 2, MtA p. 236)%0a%3c It is important to note that Ward effectively locks the spatial template of the affected area, rendering it difficult to cast ANY spell that tampers with Space into, out of, or within its confines. This includes Space-based spells performed by the Ward's creator. Keep this in mind when designing your own Sanctum's defenses; being able to Teleport doesn't help if you're cornered in a room with a Ward potency of 15. As per the Spell Control rules on p 128, a mage may take an Instant Action to modify an existing spell in her control to exclude themselves and/or others. In the case of Ward, exempting a target enables that character to freely cast Space magic within, into, or out of its confines...as well as no longer being under the aegis of the Ward’s protection from Space magic, even while standing within the Warded area.%0a%3c %0a%3c Sympathetic Magic (Space 2, MtA p. 114-116)%0a%3c Once a mage becomes an Apprentice of Space, they have begun on the path to understanding the penultimate truth that distance is a mere illusion. As the first step on the path to achieving that state, the mage learns to extend his senses beyond his mundane reach, able to scry upon distant locations and affect targets with his magic at an extreme distance.%0a%3c %0a%3c Sympathetic casting at its strongest operates on the principle of like affects like. Since distance is meaningless, if you have a piece of a person - whether it’s hair, blood, etc. - affecting the piece of them that you have with magic is just as good as affecting the person themselves. Alternatively, a mage can rely on their own intimate knowledge of the target, but this kind of sympathetic connection is less flexible and can cut both ways.%0a%3c %0a%3c The advantage (or in some cases disadvantage) of physical connections to a target like blood and hair is that the sample can be used by anyone with sufficient Space to sympathetically affect the target. A more intimate conceptual/emotional connection between oneself and the target cannot be used by a third party to affect either target, but generally speaking if a caster can claim such a connection to the target, the target can claim such a connection right back for the purposes of their own spells. This could be useful if the other mage is an ally, or a hindrance if the other mage is actually planning to betray you.%0a%3c %0a%3c There are two categories of physical substances when speaking in terms of living targets; Greater and Lesser pieces. Greater pieces are things like hair, nail clippings, blood, teeth, or bits of flesh. Lesser pieces are things like sweat, oil, or urine. The general guidelines for determining whether a sample is a Greater or Lesser piece can be settled by a couple of questions. First, is the piece something that was meant to be expelled from the body? If yes, then it is a Lesser piece. If not, proceed to the second question; did it require conscious effort on the part of someone to remove it from the target? If yes, then it is a Greater piece.%0a%3c %0a%3c So for example, blood would always be a Greater piece, since it is generally not supposed to be anywhere other than in a person’s veins, and the only way to get it out is to deliberately wound oneself or another. A dead leaf that has fallen from a tree, however, would be a Lesser piece.%0a%3c %0a%3c Furthermore, in the case of biological samples taken from still-living beings, samples WILL eventually rot away physically (and over the course of the process lose their sympathetic connection as the state of the sample moves further and further away from that of the still-living target). If the ST determines that the sample is one that will degrade, assume that if no preventative measures are taken, biological samples will degrade one step on the Sympathy chart every two weeks until it has degraded down to Unknown, at which time the sample is useless for the purposes of sympathetically casting against the target.%0a%3c %0a%3c Sympathetically targeting a location for the purposes of scrying works in much the same way. Having a piece of the location’s physical substance is a great way to achieve a strong sympathetic link, while more conceptual ties require more intimate knowledge of the location.%0a%3c %0a%3c In order to avoid confusion, the sympathetic casting chart has been split up into two, one for living targets and one for places/objects, with the specific requirements of each tier of connection to that particular target.%0a%3c %0a%3c Living Target		Object or Location	%0a%3c Dice Penalty	Sympathetic Connection Between Caster and Target	Dice Penalty	Sympathetic Connection Between Caster and Target%0a%3c -	Sensory: You can, see, hear, or otherwise sense your target directly.

You must at least know a name, description, or location or address.%0a%3c %0a%3c Ban (Space 3, MtA p. 237)%0a%3c This spell, while good conceptually, is sadly mechanically vague. To clarify, replace the second and third paragraphs of the spell's text with the following:%0a%3c %0a%3c The Ban must be cast in combination with the appropriate dot of the Arcanum governing a given phenomenon (say, Forces 2 for fire or Forces 5 for nuclear radiation). Thus, a mage with the right Arcanum knowledge could prevent insects (Life), metal objects (Matter), spirits (Spirit) or even people (Life) from intruding upon a given location. The subject of a Ban can be as general or specific as a mage wishes and ranging from "all energy" (meaning that the energy currently within the location remains there and no new energy can enter) to "thrown rocks" (meaning that rocks can be carried in, but those thrown at the space are repelled) to "Jerry's albino boa constrictor, Lucifer" (which keeps that one snake, and only that snake, out). The more inclusive a phenomenon is, the higher the penalty is to the spellcasting roll. "All energy" might impose a -3 penalty (and require Forces 5) while "Jerry's albino boa constrictor, Lucifer" might invoke no penalty (and require Life 2). Banning multiple phenomenon counts as a new Ban spell for each one (so, Bans against insects, metal objects and spirits require three different Ban spells unless the spells are cast together as a Combined Spell, per the normal combining spells rules).%0a%3c %0a%3c The phenomenon must make an appropriate roll to enter a Banned area (if it doesn't already). A Banned person walking into the area may require Strength + Athletics while casting a spell into an area banned against magic would use the spell's rote pool (or Arcanum + Gnosis, whichever is appropriate; note that Space effects have to contend with the Ward in addition to relevant Bans). The successes of the roll or Potency of appropriate spells must exceed the Ban's Potency. Otherwise, the Ban holds – Banned people bounce off, and Banned spells fail within that area (although an area outside the Ban is affected by the spell normally). Each time one of the appropriate phenomena breaches the Ban, the phenomenon erodes the Ban's Potency by one point, reducing the Ban's efficacy. Note that phenomenon that can't make a test (such as an area over a river that has a Ban against water) simply fails to penetrate the Ban.%0a%3c %0a%3c Successive Ban spells add their excess Potency to the Ban (that is, any Potency in excess of the Ban's existing Potency), repairing any damage inflicted and perhaps even improving upon defenses. (The defending mage does not need to create a Ban all over again unless it has been destroyed). Reinforcing a Ban is an exception to the normal spell control rules.%0a%3c %0a%3c Time%0a%3c %0a%3c Augury (Time 2, MtA p. 258)%0a%3c Augury can be a useful spell, but unfortunately not everyone understands what it can and cannot do. Augury relies on Temporal Sympathy with the target of the spell to make a simple divination about the target’s future. A simple divination is a simple question that nets a general answer. ‘Yes or no’ questions are usually appropriate.%0a%3c %0a%3c So for example, asking “Is the lottery ticket in my hand the winning ticket?” is valid, since you have the target in hand and you know when the drawing is going to be, giving you plenty of Temporal Sympathy to start with. The answer is also a simple ‘yes’ or ‘no.’ Asking “What are the winning lottery numbers this week going to be?” isn’t valid, since you have not only targeted something conceptual (random numbers to be determined at a later date), but have also asked for a specific result, which isn’t within the spell’s purview.%0a%3c %0a%3c [--%25color=#365776%25[[#top| Back to top]]--]%0a%3c %0a%3c %0a%3c [[#TC]]%0a%3c !!Territory%0a%3c %0a%3c Territory:%0a%3c 	%0a%3c First off, you do not need to be in a cabal to request territory. An individual mage may reques this of the Consilium. Some Mages, with a certain degree of clout, can request personal domains, personal territory, that they are responsible for. Until people reach this level of clout then they need to be in a cabal, as this is the easiest way to request territory. Realize, when you request territory you will be expected to “Police” it. It’s your yard, you need to take responsibility for it. Keep that in mind when you request territory. For example, if you request an area with a high Seers influence you may be expected to take the war to their door.%0a%3c %0a%3c You can ask for territory, personal or cabal and the Council of the Consilium can approve it. (It is good to know people.) They may approve your request, they may approve some of your request, and they may deny your request, some or all of it. My suggestion is that you think your territory request through, keep it reasonable. The Council is under no obligation to give a Mage who asks for 5 blocks to be their territory all 5 blocks at the same time, they may offer a cabal with a long service history to the Consilium more territory than requested. Territory is not a one-way street, once you have a certain area you are responsible for that area, you will have to have some form of presence or awareness. If bad things happen in your back yard you will be the first to be asked WTF?%0a%3c %0a%3c 	%0a%3c Territories do not include major arteries of transportation.  Road and waterways are considered free passage. If you are on the interstate, and it crosses a territory, don’t get off at that exit. Go on to the next one and then head where you are going. If there are major businesses, clubs, gathering points in a territory then these will be considered neutral ground. There is no need to tell a cabal that you are going to get your dance on, but, should you do something to attract attention in that area while enjoying the neutral ground, you may be called on your actions and perhaps banned from an area. While you are on the major routes (and we are talking; highways, state roads, main streets and the like) you are not busting into someone’s territory. If you go sightseeing into a cabal’s territory by tooling around their barrio, then you either ask permission, or you hope you do not get caught.%0a%3c %0a%3c NOTE: (THIS IS IMPORTANT)%0a%3c %0a%3c 	Let’s say you have a sanctum and you want to remain all secret and sneaky like. Ok, that’s cool I can dig that for a Mage. But! When a cabal gets formed and requests territory, and that territory just happens to have your hidden sanctum in the middle of it, it is now up to you to work it out IC with them. There will be no “Oh I meant to ask for that area.” being done after the fact. You need to get in front of the council and ask, or if a cabal moves in and they find you, they have the right to evict you. They can charge you rent in tass, or something else, and you either need to fork it over or you need to move. KEEP THIS IN MIND! If not, you need to hide, and that is where it gets interesting.%0a%3c %0a%3c [--%25color=#365776%25[[#top| Back to top]]--]%0a
