Some Lost speculate that the Black Company is no one entity but the endless warehouse of file cabinets and safes bearing all of the recorded, stolen information and objects that it has gathered since it was first conceived.  Still others insist that while wandering through the stacks they were met with the true Keeper; a large being with a head made up of several televisions all showing security cameras which spoke in a vocally modified tone that not unlike Deep Throat.  There are those that insist that the Black Company is truly run from the phone calls that each of its agents receives; existing only as pure information and trying to re-assemble itself together from the scattered pieces of lore that used to comprise the Company before it lost a duel with another Keeper.%0a%0aThe truth may never be known.%0a%0a%0a'''An Offer You Can't Refuse'''%0a%0aThe Black Company always comes respectably to those who have need.  It comes in a suit and tie and with a briefcase and lawyers and contracts offering a deal; they were watching you before and they like how you think.  They know you've gotten in too deep and you're looking for a way out.  You really don't have any other options in your situation, but, if you consider their offer it'll just be a few years of contract work.... you'll get out of whatever danger scot free.  You'll be set for life.  You'll have everything you need.  It's as easy as that, just sign on the dotted line and we'll get started.%0a%0aWhat they don't tell you is that just under the dotted line is the cost for the servitude; every last Changeling taken by the Black Company has had their face cut from them and stored away with their contract for "safe keeping" before being given a new one.  The deal, in theory, is for a few years of work and then you get back your face and whatever else you were offered before being on your way.  It rarely, if ever, works out that way.%0a%0aAlmost immediately Changelings are then put on assignment.  Some are sent out on missions to recover this bit of information or retrieve a necklace from that Keeper's nightstand -- a truly dangerous endeavor for newly changed Lost even when they are given a cover identity and a story.  Some are scheduled to look after other cells to make certain they are behaving and aren't working as a "double agent" attempting to "defect" though who can tell if the defectors that are found and re-educated were even planning to escape at all?  There is a high level of paranoia and threat at all times at HQ.%0a%0aChangelings who survive their first few missions can find themselves in quite a comfortable lifestyle indeed.  In fact, they may find themselves living out a James Bond style fantasy of spy games and world travel, jet setting as they seduce this beautiful woman and play baccarat with that foreign dignitary.  Indeed, this is what makes the Black Company a truly dangerous Keeper as an unsurprisingly high amount of Loyalists come from its number.  After all, who wants to go back to a life where you were just a criminal on the streets?  And, if you've already gotten the thrill of missions where you're under deep cover... what's one more?  Ironically, this also serves as one of the benefits to the Changelings who are Kept by the Black Company as with its endless bureaucracy more than a few brave souls have simply filed themselves as being away on a "retrieval mission" and run to never return.%0a%0aOf course... if those papers showing they left the Black Company for "retrieval" were to find their way to the Freehold they escaped to?  Well... that's a risk worth taking, right?%0a%0aRight?%0a%0aFor the most part the Black Company is neither kind nor cruel.  It is an agency that seems to lack agency of itself; gathering information, threats, blackmail, items and trading them off to market for some purpose that no one could hope to understand.  One week Black Company Agents might smuggle Lady Thalia's prized Nightingale-Changeling out to the slave markets.  Another an agent might be sent to make sure that The Many Handed Lord is aware that his wife, Sahshan of the Winds has taken a new lover.  And, little by little the Black Company robs its Changelings subtly of their own identity -- stealing little bits of information (again, to trade on market) during de-briefing to try and make sure that there isn't enough of them left to ever find their way back home.  And those that do?%0a%0aWell, that's what the Black Company wanted in the end.%0a%0aStill, there are those who got their contract back completed and done at the end of their servitude and were just released like the Company said.  Even the True Fae have to honor their deals.  That was that -- faces back, names back, whatever they were promised back and the Changeling steps on through to their life having escaped any consequences.%0a%0aMaybe.%0a%0aProbably.%0a%0a''Possibly''%0a%0a[[%3c%3c]]%0a%0ahttp://wantonwicked.gamingsandbox.com/wiki/images/ctl/headers/ctl_h.png%0a%25rframe%25 http://images.wikia.com/creepypasta/images/d/d4/Endless_Hallway.jpg%0a%0aThe domain of the Black Company begins like one would expect; a faceless governmental building full of endless halls that have vague titles on them and mildly annoying music.  Each Changeling has their own office (with a door!) that sports a desk, some paper and pencil to make reports, and a few other office amenities.  There are no windows, only a wall of televisions that seem to switch randomly from altered real world stations to other cubicles to different parts of the hedge.  The Black Company sees all.%0a%0aThose who have displeased the company or failed in their duties are often banished to the stacks for non-active duty time (which, sadly, doesn't count against your contract time as you'll see under sub-heading A, paragraph 173 on page 4427) wherein they are to file, categorize and sort the near endless information steadily pouring in from the Black Company's agents.%0a%0aFor the majority of Changelings under the Black Company, however, they are travelling -- usually by a somewhat 1930s style train car which seems to stretch along through the realms of other Fae and always with an agent of the Black Company known as the Seeing Eye.  In the train the Seeing Eye takes its true form (perhaps?), looking arly blank faced except for upsetting eyes and a mouth... however, during missions it morphs to look like whatever is appropriate.  Whether the Seeing Eye is a title for upper-level Mirrorskins or an avatar of the Agency is a highly sought after bit of information.  As several exist at one time and they do not seem to be particularly powerful it seems doubtful that this is the true face of the Keeper.%0a%0a[[%3c%3c]]%0a%0ahttp://wantonwicked.gamingsandbox.com/wiki/images/ctl/headers/ctl_rph.png%0a%0a'''The Information Market:'''%0aAn Agent of the Black Company (a loyalist?  A bound Changeling still under contract?  It's always hard to tell) visits the markets every now and then in New Arcadia on the look out for new information.  A brave (or stupid) Changeling could even take up a contract with the Earthly members of the Black Company.  They always get their jobs done, after all, and it's not dealing with a Keeper... right?%0a%0a'''De-Activated Agents:'''%0aStrange for a Keeper, the Black Company is not particularly concerned with trying to collect back servants.  Sometimes it fails to notice them, sometimes it simply lets their presence go without concern, and sometimes it sends an agent to respond cheerfully to them or even help them quite publicly so everyone knows they were once an agent.  Usually that causes problems enough.  Black Company agents, however, are notorious for taking bounties up for missing information of OTHER Keepers and selling back that information.  Of course, for a proper deal they might sell something false, too...  %0a%0a'''Everything's For Sale:'''%0aDue to it being primarily an information agency the Black Market does on occasion set up booths to sell bits that it might find interesting at market.  It offers anything from fetch location to gossip about the concerns of the Keepers.  More interestingly to those who were its former Changelings, also up for sale on occasion are those stolen bits and memories that it cut out in order to make space for the secret identities, manchurian codes and whatever else happened in the Debriefing Room.  %0a%0a'''File 27-B:''' (Frailty)%0aWhile not necessarily a frailty the Black Company does honor all of its contracts.  A few Changelings have returned from the hedge clutching a piece of paper listing the end of their services with little else to show but mental scars and a lost sense of self.  What is truly worthy of note is that the Black Company does not seem to be able to resist the idea of new information.  Any non-menial fact (do you know what I ate for breakfast) about someone other than the Changeling in question that it was not privy to is enough to entice it to make a deal.  Further, it is not omnipotent.  It can be tricked and lied to by those with the daring to do so though it is far from easy.  A rumor says that a whole cell of Changelings once escaped when a woman known as Clever Lanka spun a tall tale in order to free her compatriots.%0a%0aThey lived quite happily for six years, even being seen by some agents from time to time at market, until one night Lanka got drunk and told a hob that the story she'd given the Black Company was all lies.  Men came with black bags came for every member of the freehold that night, leaving only one behind.  A year later a group of twenty four mentally impaired changelings were found roaming the streets of Leningrad, unable to do more than shuffle about and mutter, and robbed of even enough mental faculties to keep from defecating themselves.  The last remaining member of the freehold verified them as the missing changelings before mercifully killing them rather than letting them be institutionalized.  %0a[[%3c%3c]]%0a%0ahttp://wantonwicked.gamingsandbox.com/wiki/images/ctl/headers/ctl_q.png%0a%0a%0a''But the question remains: does all of this have to happen again?'' -- [[StephanieKim|Stephanie Kim]]%0a%0a[[%3c%3c]]%0a%0a(:include CityBook.ChangelingNavigationBar:)
