His square jaw and and short blonde hair mark out a handsome face marred by an unsettling intensity in his pale blue eyes.

Genteel and capable, he quickly found a place in Kindred society.  When Gideon is not cultivating his own projects, he serves the Carthian Movement mentoring fledglings, mediating disputes, and clerking with the Senate.  Gideon has become known recently for pushing a social agenda of legal reform.  The proclamations of the Senate and the Prince, Ward says, are not sufficient to properly order society.  Kindred Society ought to adopt proper law for contracts and property, in addition to the Traditions and the old laws fiefdoms.''%0a%0a''In Gideon's mortal days, now nearly thirty years past, the man was an upstanding man from a proud family.  At the apex of an enviable career, Judge Ward sat on the bench of the Georgia Court of Appeals, and was on the verge of an appointment to the Georgia Supreme Court.  But then Gideon Ward died.''%0a%0a''Gideon spent the better part of the next ten years in Atlanta before returning to his native Savannah.''[[%3c%3c]]%0a%0a%25%25http://wantonwicked.gamingsandbox.com/wiki/images/vtr/headers/vtr_con.png%0a%25lfloat width=70px%25http://i10.photobucket.com/albums/a110/JustineNuara/EdwardCorey_zps85141023.jpg%0a[[Edward Corey]]   '''Carthian'''; ''Gideon holds tenancy in the Central District under this Carthian luminary.

Gideon keeps his secret closely, and interacts only at a distance, but it's possible others in respectable civic groups may feel his influence.%0a%0a*''Zealous Advocate (Vampires)'': %0aGideon offers counsel and advocacy to any who need it, at a modest price.  He will offer advice on the Requiem or on mortal society, negotiate disputes, and work to get Kindred out of trouble with the authorities.  Perhaps you've asked Gideon's help before, or perhaps you might need to soon.%0a%0a*''Hunt Club (Vampires, Mortals)'': %0aIn life and in death, hunting has long been a past-time for Gideon Ward.  As a vampire, Gideon has so many more opportunities for quarry.  Whether for animals or kine, Gideon invites his fellow Kindred out for sport, and enjoys making a game of it.  Going "fox" hunting on stolen steeds or playing a friendly game of "tag" with .22 rifles are all Gideon's ideas of a good time.  Gideon has his limits, though--it's gauche to kill kine for sport.  Maybe you want to go hunting with Gideon, or maybe you end up quarry.%0a[[%3c%3c]]%0a%0a%25%25http://wantonwicked.gamingsandbox.com/wiki/images/vtr/headers/vtr_q.png%0a''Adio Iman.'' -- [-(scrawled on her hand)-][[%3c%3c]]%0a''When we don't know who to hate, we hate ourselves.''-- [[Ashildr de Haviland]]%0a%0a''Those little white shorts suit him, strangely enough.'' -- [[Rebekah Fuchs]]%0a%0a''Drive your cart and your plow over the bones of the dead.
