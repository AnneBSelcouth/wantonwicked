Fifty years ago a member of the Mysterium, whose name has been lost, almost destroyed the Athenaeum from within. In a fit of madness, or rage, the member incinerated volumes of work regarding the –Hattan- Project, supposedly destroyed at least one soul stone, and caused undisclosed amounts of other damage before they were either destroyed or driven off. The damage caused by this rogue mage affected the exterior of the building as well as the interior, not to mention the people who were inside at the time. Since then, the Athenaeum of Savannah has looked like a charred hulk, a derelict structure, a beautiful illusion.%0a>  %0a> The Mysterium of Savannah have a tradition going back to the first Hierophant, a Moros named -Soli-, to lead the order. Since the original, each Hierophant has donated a soulstone to the continued strength and growth of the Athenaeum. Because of this, the Athenaeum is not only the strongest Demense in Savannah, but in Georgia as there are no less than 8 soulstones, potentially as many at 10, in its circle of power.%0a> %0a> The building is three stories, and is only accessible through the area once intended for freight. There are existing wards, bans, and other spells that defend the property. Most of which are focused on keeping sleepers disinterested in some Urban Spelunking and Trespassing. One of the more ingenious spells, a thaumaturgy created by an Obrimos shortly after the building was wired for electricity, causes all the window panes, even those missing, to darken at night.. To most, the building is just an abandoned relic, never quite becoming an eye-sore, never falling apart enough to worry others.%0a> %0a> !!!Consilium Known:%0a> *The Mysterium does allow Consilium member to occasionally consult the Library of the Athenaeum. The Library is open to use for Spirit, natural History, Savannah History, Native American Practices, Geomancy, Ley Energy, Ghosts and Southern Cooking. Those Consilium members who have been inside the Athenaeum say that it feels much smaller inside than the building looks outside, a feeling that takes some getting used to.%0a> *There is a sizable scriptorium on the premises, but these facilities are only open to members of the Mysterium. %0a> *Rumor has it that there is a dueling area, one that has been used outside of the purview of the Sentinels, for what the Mysterium might occasionally refer to as “internal debates.” %0a> *There are monastery like cells for Mysterium members to use when they wish to stay at the Athenaeum, complete with a communal kitchen and small socializing area. %0a> *Other rumors suggest that there is also an area for experimentation, whether alchemical, arcane, or other experiments. One member of the Consilium spoke of seeing what they called “blast doors” when they were researching something in the athenaeum.%0a> %0a> [--%25color=#365776%25[[#top| Back to top]]--]%0a> %0a> [[#BT]]%0a> !!Beautiful Thieves%0a> ''[[Players.MageOrders|The Mysterium]]''\\%0a> %0a> %0a> %25rfloat text-align=center margin-top=5px margin-right=0px margin-bottom=5px margin-left=15px%25http://wantonwicked.gamingsandbox.com/wiki/images/mta/locations/beautifulthieves1.jpg%0a> Half art gallery, half pub, Beautiful Thieves a 3 story art bar located on W.

The Third floor, set up more like a salon than a home, is a meeting place of the Mysterium away from the Athenaeum. A casual space that is used, with and without –Aislin- being present; like the Athenaeum, there are some doors that do remained locked. Many have wonder why –Aislin- continued to live, or tend to this location, what with her going blind several years ago.

A medium security prison, the population is strictly male inmates. The Prison itself has a pristine history, actually breaking the mold of housing inmates without rehabilitation, with no incidents of wrong doing or riots. This would seem to be ideal, except that Coastal State is known to be under the auspices of the Seers of the Throne. At least one recognized and named Seer, -Thrush- is an associate warden. There is rumored to be an entire pylon working in the prison, or intermixed with the inmates. %0a> %0a> %25lfloat text-align=center margin-top=5px margin-right=15px margin-bottom=5px margin-left=0px width=150px%25http://wantonwicked.gamingsandbox.com/wiki/images/mta/npcs/thrush.jpg"-Thrush-"%0a> The Savannah Consilium has not poked at the potential hornets’ nest, playing a waiting game to find out the true purpose of the Seers. Attempts to use fate, time and other arcana to divine the purpose have been fruitless as the Seers have taken steps to protect their assets and investment in the facility. Due to –Thrush’s- high profile in the mundane sense, there has been no action against her directly.

The scent of well-worn leather, dry paper and old woods dominate the smell of the first floor. Here is the collection of heirlooms, of accumulated finery arranged in some inscrutable pattern. The owner of Charlatan always seems to be able to find the right gift, right where “she put it,” when customers come a calling. While her ability to find the perfect reassure hidden or stored among all the antiques seems as a surprise to her customers, to the Awakened of Savannah, well, the name of the business says it all.

The 1st floor is the show room carrying everything from hand carved wooden furniture to antique firearms still in working order. Sets of silverware and real crystal chandeliers and mixed in with the occasional baseball card and an original acid etching of “Dark Side of the Moon.” The first floor is business, cluttered it would seem, but pristine, not a speck of dust, not one item out of place.%0a> %0a> %25lfloat text-align=center margin-top=5px margin-right=15px margin-bottom=5px margin-left=0px%25http://wantonwicked.gamingsandbox.com/wiki/images/mta/locations/charlatanantiquesandgifts2.jpg%0a> The basement, of course, is where the creepy curios are kept, because to do anything else would be foolish. The basement is part restoration area, part macabre keepsake display. The items, some of them, are for sale, others are not. Charlatan has been known, on the occasion, to traffic in arcane items; more than one Mysterium member has conducted business on the premises… for a fee of course.%0a> %0a> The top floor is living space and meeting space for the Silver Ladder.

The main theater has shown movies, held plays and operas, has been used for benefits, for student productions, has even seen the likes of Gallagher and other comedians. The main hall has been restored and is “quaint” with a seating of just over 1,400. But that is part of the Southern charm, the closeness, the need to know who is around you.%0a> %0a> While mortal work and productions do on, the Free Council holds sway in the “offices” of the theater. The building has 2 levels of basement, and then a sub-basement below that. These areas are off-limits to other awakened, and are only in use during theatrical productions.

Located on the southern bank of the Savannah, the park is not much more than a green space attached to a parking lot for the Waving Girl and Hutchinson Island ferries. There are pieces of art, metal sculptures on display from SCAD, there is a simple walking path lined by trees and a good view of the Savannah River. Simple, nice, and as mundane as can be, the park fits in with the sedate atmosphere of Savannah. %0a> %0a> Of course, that is because there is no swimming in the Savannah, and the storm drains from the city are usually hidden beneath the pilings of the wharf for the ferries. Good thing they are mostly hidden, otherwise some enterprising soul might try and get into them. Back in the less than pristine history of Savannah, some of those drains were used to smuggle goods, including people, to and from the city. According to myth, least one of the drains will lead its way back to the Pirate’s House, though that has never been confirmed.%0a> %0a> This myth is true, though the way is a bit more convoluted with precautions against flooding. In the event of an emergency, the escape route is still there, waiting. It is rumored that at least one GoV escaped the pogrom against their order by using the old passages, passages that had not been used since Prohibition.%0a> %0a> Currently Morell Park is tended by the Adamantine Arrow.

The square has seen some fame, housing the first Royal Governor of Georgia at one point, but now is home to bed and breakfasts, parking lots, and other businesses. The businesses are not the important part of the square, the focus is on the park in the center.%0a> %0a> Near the center of the square, not to off from the Oglethorpe Square House, is a Sundial. The sundial faithful follows the shadow created by the sun, a shadow many sleeper has come to look at, well, to see at least once. What people don’t know is that the sundial , if looked at more intently, is accurate… down to the second, in regards to the placement of the sun. Somehow it auto-corrects, and even on a cloudy day people say that they can sometimes see a shadow representing the time.%0a> %0a> %25rfloat text-align=center margin-top=5px margin-right=0px margin-bottom=5px margin-left=15px%25http://wantonwicked.gamingsandbox.com/wiki/images/mta/locations/oglethorpesquare2.jpg%0a> To an awakened, there is something a little different going on. Looking at the sundial with certain magesights will give the Awakened a different picture than a normal sundial might provide. Instead of a shadow telling the time they see a shadow moving backwards, as if counting down. This shadow is not dependent on the sun, in fact, the shadow moves backwards no matter what time of day or night. There is only two problems… no one knows where the shadow began, or where it will end.%0a> %0a> %25lfloat text-align=center margin-top=5px margin-right=15px margin-bottom=5px margin-left=0px%25http://wantonwicked.gamingsandbox.com/wiki/images/mta/locations/oglethorpesquare3.jpg%0a> Because of this irregularity, -Siafu- has gained 24hr access to the nearby Oglethorpe Square House. It is –Siafu’s belief, and now a belief shared by more than just a few members of the Consilium, that this square will be the next location for the Hallows created by –Hattan’s- battery.

There will be something more concrete in the future, but what the Consilium does is use a facility as a meeting place, rarely using the same place twice. Often appearing as an investment group, alumni, boosters or any of a number of organizations, the Consilium stays mobile instead of static. This form of mobile council was a result of the Pogrom against the GoV. The traditional Consilum meeting place of Wormsloe is still used, but sometimes a quick meeting has to happen in the city, and the public buildings SCAD are often times the most spacious and easiest to attain, defend and disappear from without anyone the wiser.%0a> %0a> [--%25color=#365776%25[[#top| Back to top]]--]%0a> %0a> [[#WP]]%0a> !!Wormsloe Plantation (Historic Site)%0a> [[CityBook.MageSettingConsilium|Consilium]]%0a> %0a> %0a> %25lfloat text-align=center margin-top=5px margin-right=15px margin-bottom=5px margin-left=0px%25http://wantonwicked.gamingsandbox.com/wiki/images/mta/locations/wormsloeplantation.jpg%0a> In 1736, Noble Jones obtained a grant for 500 acres (2.0 km2) of land on the Isle of Hope that would form the core of Wormsloe. He constructed a fortified house on the southeastern tip of the island overlooking the Skidaway Narrows, a strategic section of the Skidaway River located along the intracoastal waterway roughly halfway between downtown Savannah and the Atlantic Ocean. The fortified house was part of a network of defensive structures established by James Oglethorpe, founder of Georgia, and early Georgia colonists to protect Savannah from a potential Spanish invasion. Jones subsequently developed Wormsloe into a small plantation, and his descendants built a large mansion at the site which they used as a country residence.The State of Georgia acquired the bulk of the Wormsloe Plantation in 1973 and opened it to the public as a state historic site in 1979.%0a> %0a> !!!The Mansion%0a> %0a> %25rfloat text-align=center margin-top=5px margin-right=0px margin-bottom=5px margin-left=15px%25http://wantonwicked.gamingsandbox.com/wiki/images/mta/locations/wormsloeplantation2.jpg%0a> The Mansion is certainly spacious enough for Savannah’s Consilium, luckily the Consilium does not meet that often. When it does, the staff is reduced, and those who remain are sleepwalkers often tied with the various orders. The bar is often self-serve, and the kitchen is closed after providing finger foods and hors d’oeuvres, cleanup is simple as each member of the Consilium is expected to police themselves, Southern manners and all. The Consilium is careful about its presence in the Mansion; the building is old, a history hidden in the woods.

Hidden away south of Savannah, the Wormsloe house is by the Consilium for an Occasional gathering, one that can host the various and numerous Awakened of the city. Not too far from the main house, nee mansion, is a private cemetery once used by the Jones family. This would not be of note, as many properties had private cemeteries back in the early colonial period, but the boundaries of the cemetery act as a Demense. It has been standing law that the area is left undisturbed in regards to the nature of the Demense, but it has been, at times, been used with the permission of the Hierarch, to practice, research, and experiment with arcana.%0a> %0a> !!!The Dueling House%0a> %0a> %25rfloat text-align=center margin-top=5px margin-right=0px margin-bottom=5px margin-left=15px%25http://wantonwicked.gamingsandbox.com/wiki/images/mta/locations/wormsloeplantation2.jpg %0a> Formal duels, accepted by multiple parties and with the permission of the Sentinels or the Consilium, have used this building on the former plantation’s main grounds for decades. The Dueling House, as it is known among the Awakened, was once a church on the Wormsloe Plantation. Even before its acquisition by the State of Georgia, this building had been the site of duels dating back to the early 20th century. The Consilium of Savannah, with the Plantation tenant’s unknowing permission and then with the state’s, has been using the former church for decades. First as a meeting place, and then as formal location for duels, the small building has seen the rise of the Savannah Consilium from the day its first stone was laid in a foundation.

It is thought[by whom?] to be the oldest standing building in the state of Georgia.%0a> %0a> It may not look like much on the outside, but the Pirate’s House has been seen more than a few days, more than a few faces, and has many secrets to tell. The wooden building, with washed out plank siding and simple post and lintel construction has been a mainstay of Savannah, for better or worse, since it first opened its doors in 1753.

Besides beer, food and wenches, the “Pirate House” did a brisk trade in something else; they found new sailors for the ships. Rather than going to all the trouble of convincing people of what a nice life it was at sea (people knew better) they simply kidnapped them.%0a> %0a> This entry, you see, was the dumping point for men who had drank to much, been roofied by the owners of the bar, or just beaten over the head with a cudgel if they were stubborn enough to resist the loaded drinks. The good news, you could never say that the beer was watered down, the bad news, you could say that once you found yourself in the middle of an ocean.

Unbeknownst to most people walking the street of Savannah, one of those tunnels still exists, connecting The Pirate’s House to Morrell Park, less than a quarter of a mile apart, one of the Ferry landings on the southern bank of the Savannah River. This is unknown to the sleepers, not so much to the Awakened.%0a> %0a> The Pirate house still has some of those rooms open so that customers can see what life could have been like in the part, of course, the Consilium has a different use for those tunnels. One of the basement tunnels has a warded passage, a wall that is solid and innocuous to a sleeper as they suddenly remember it was time to go and have another drink, another cigarette, any normal and mundane reason not to tarry to long beneath the pub. To a sleepwalker, the tunnel itself is… interesting, but in the way that gives an itch to the back of the neck, and a desire to go and get some fresh air. For the Awakened, heading to the tunnel leads them to a dead end with a simple wrought Iron door that is locked.

Starting with a mask of normality that is consistently on, when High speech is uttered around the gate there is a triggered Sense consciousness before the gate then opens. As the gate opens it casts a, for lack of a better term, eternal now on any sleepers within the area, in the tunnels or directly about them. At the same time there is a temporary incognito presence and imposter cast on any awakened entering the gate. The combination works that the sleepers don’t see anyone passing through, forgetting the person there a minute ago, perhaps passing them off as a ghost… the building is haunted you know.%0a> %0a> The combination of spells at the iron gate was placed by a master Mastigos in the early 1900’s, back when there was a revitalized interest in the darker histories of Savannah coincided with Prohibition. The basement of the Pirate’s House was first converted into a speak easy, the Awakened just assumed ownership of this portion of the building, making people forget about its existence. The basement has draught beer and a liquor shelf as stocked as the one above them in the main premises. Sadly, there is no kitchen in the basement, so the bar usually has pre-made sandwiches and bar nuts ( yes, the bar nuts are always stale.)%0a> %0a> %25lfloat text-align=center margin-top=5px margin-right=15px margin-bottom=5px margin-left=0px%25http://wantonwicked.gamingsandbox.com/wiki/images/mta/locations/thepirateshouse4.jpg%0a> %0a> Since its inception, the Awakened have always been involved with the Pirate’s House in one way or another. Sometimes as staff, other times as managers and owners, the Awakened presence around the building has seeped into the frame. There is an overall positive vibe about the building, a distraction for those still asleep that allows them to relax, to enjoy. It allows for the Awakened to continue about their business with some freedom, and occasionally get a good buzz while doing it.%0a> %0a> The Pirate’s house has changed hands between orders several times, sometimes used as a bartering chip, other times as a marker on a debt, the current owners of the Pirate House are the Silver Ladder.

Fifty years ago a member of the Mysterium, whose name has been lost, almost destroyed the Athenaeum from within. In a fit of madness, or rage, the member incinerated volumes of work regarding the –Hattan- Project, supposedly destroyed at least one soul stone, and caused undisclosed amounts of other damage before they were either destroyed or driven off. The damage caused by this rogue mage affected the exterior of the building as well as the interior, not to mention the people who were inside at the time. Since then, the Athenaeum of Savannah has looked like a charred hulk, a derelict structure, a beautiful illusion.%0a%3c  %0a%3c The Mysterium of Savannah have a tradition going back to the first Hierophant, a Moros named -Soli-, to lead the order. Since the original, each Hierophant has donated a soulstone to the continued strength and growth of the Athenaeum. Because of this, the Athenaeum is not only the strongest Demense in Savannah, but in Georgia as there are no less than 8 soulstones, potentially as many at 10, in its circle of power.%0a%3c %0a%3c The building is three stories, and is only accessible through the area once intended for freight. There are existing wards, bans, and other spells that defend the property. Most of which are focused on keeping sleepers disinterested in some Urban Spelunking and Trespassing. One of the more ingenious spells, a thaumaturgy created by an Obrimos shortly after the building was wired for electricity, causes all the window panes, even those missing, to darken at night.. To most, the building is just an abandoned relic, never quite becoming an eye-sore, never falling apart enough to worry others.%0a%3c %0a%3c !!!Consilium Known:%0a%3c *The Mysterium does allow Consilium member to occasionally consult the Library of the Athenaeum. The Library is open to use for Spirit, natural History, Savannah History, Native American Practices, Geomancy, Ley Energy, Ghosts and Southern Cooking. Those Consilium members who have been inside the Athenaeum say that it feels much smaller inside than the building looks outside, a feeling that takes some getting used to.%0a%3c *There is a sizable scriptorium on the premises, but these facilities are only open to members of the Mysterium. %0a%3c *Rumor has it that there is a dueling area, one that has been used outside of the purview of the Sentinels, for what the Mysterium might occasionally refer to as “internal debates.” %0a%3c *There are monastery like cells for Mysterium members to use when they wish to stay at the Athenaeum, complete with a communal kitchen and small socializing area. %0a%3c *Other rumors suggest that there is also an area for experimentation, whether alchemical, arcane, or other experiments. One member of the Consilium spoke of seeing what they called “blast doors” when they were researching something in the athenaeum.%0a%3c %0a%3c [--%25color=#365776%25[[#top| Back to top]]--]%0a%3c %0a%3c [[#BT]]%0a%3c !!Beautiful Thieves%0a%3c ''[[Players.MageOrders|The Mysterium]]''\\%0a%3c %0a%3c %0a%3c %25rfloat text-align=center margin-top=5px margin-right=0px margin-bottom=5px margin-left=15px%25http://wantonwicked.gamingsandbox.com/wiki/images/mta/locations/beautifulthieves1.jpg%0a%3c Half art gallery, half pub, Beautiful Thieves a 3 story art bar located on W.

The scent of well-worn leather, dry paper and old woods dominate the smell of the first floor. Here is the collection of heirlooms, of accumulated finery arranged in some inscrutable pattern. The owner of Charlatan always seems to be able to find the right gift, right where “she put it,” when customers come a calling. While her ability to find the perfect reassure hidden or stored among all the antiques seems as a surprise to her customers, to the Awakened of Savannah, well, the name of the business says it all.

The 1st floor is the show room carrying everything from hand carved wooden furniture to antique firearms still in working order. Sets of silverware and real crystal chandeliers and mixed in with the occasional baseball card and an original acid etching of “Dark Side of the Moon.” The first floor is business, cluttered it would seem, but pristine, not a speck of dust, not one item out of place.%0a%3c %0a%3c %25lfloat text-align=center margin-top=5px margin-right=15px margin-bottom=5px margin-left=0px%25http://wantonwicked.gamingsandbox.com/wiki/images/mta/locations/charlatanantiquesandgifts2.jpg%0a%3c The basement, of course, is where the creepy curios are kept, because to do anything else would be foolish. The basement is part restoration area, part macabre keepsake display. The items, some of them, are for sale, others are not.

The main theater has shown movies, held plays and operas, has been used for benefits, for student productions, has even seen the likes of Gallagher and other comedians. The main hall has been restored and is “quaint” with a seating of just over 1,400. But that is part of the Southern charm, the closeness, the need to know who is around you.%0a%3c %0a%3c While mortal work and productions do on, the Free Council holds sway in the “offices” of the theater. The building has 2 levels of basement, and then a sub-basement below that. These areas are off-limits to other awakened, and are only in use during theatrical productions. Even then, those who try and sneak around when the Libertines aren't looking learn the same lesson that Firmin and Andre learn in Paris; there are many secrets in the heart of a theater. %0a%3c %0a%3c %25rfloat text-align=center margin-top=5px margin-right=0px margin-bottom=5px margin-left=15px%25http://wantonwicked.gamingsandbox.com/wiki/images/mta/npcs/crier.jpg%0a%3c -Crier-, Enchantress of the Free Council, is a member of the board that operates the Lucas, she is also an administrator with SCAD, thus tying the two together.

Located on the southern bank of the Savannah, the park is not much more than a green space attached to a parking lot for the Waving Girl and Hutchinson Island ferries. There are pieces of art, metal sculptures on display from SCAD, there is a simple walking path lined by trees and a good view of the Savannah River. Simple, nice, and as mundane as can be, the park fits in with the sedate atmosphere of Savannah. %0a%3c %0a%3c Of course, that is because there is no swimming in the Savannah, and the storm drains from the city are usually hidden beneath the pilings of the wharf for the ferries. Good thing they are mostly hidden, otherwise some enterprising soul might try and get into them. Back in the less than pristine history of Savannah, some of those drains were used to smuggle goods, including people, to and from the city. According to myth, least one of the drains will lead its way back to the Pirate’s House, though that has never been confirmed.%0a%3c %0a%3c This myth is true, though the way is a bit more convoluted with precautions against flooding.

The businesses are not the important part of the square, the focus is on the park in the center.%0a%3c %0a%3c Near the center of the square, not to off from the Oglethorpe Square House, is a Sundial. The sundial faithful follows the shadow created by the sun, a shadow many sleeper has come to look at, well, to see at least once. What people don’t know is that the sundial , if looked at more intently, is accurate… down to the second, in regards to the placement of the sun. Somehow it auto-corrects, and even on a cloudy day people say that they can sometimes see a shadow representing the time.%0a%3c %0a%3c %25rfloat text-align=center margin-top=5px margin-right=0px margin-bottom=5px margin-left=15px%25http://wantonwicked.gamingsandbox.com/wiki/images/mta/locations/oglethorpesquare2.jpg%0a%3c To an awakened, there is something a little different going on. Looking at the sundial with certain magesights will give the Awakened a different picture than a normal sundial might provide. Instead of a shadow telling the time they see a shadow moving backwards, as if counting down. This shadow is not dependent on the sun, in fact, the shadow moves backwards no matter what time of day or night. There is only two problems… no one knows where the shadow began, or where it will end.%0a%3c %0a%3c %25lfloat text-align=center margin-top=5px margin-right=15px margin-bottom=5px margin-left=0px%25http://wantonwicked.gamingsandbox.com/wiki/images/mta/locations/oglethorpesquare3.jpg%0a%3c Because of this irregularity, -Siafu- has gained 24hr access to the nearby Oglethorpe Square House.

Often appearing as an investment group, alumni, boosters or any of a number of organizations, the Consilium stays mobile instead of static. This form of mobile council was a result of the Pogrom against the GoV.

He constructed a fortified house on the southeastern tip of the island overlooking the Skidaway Narrows, a strategic section of the Skidaway River located along the intracoastal waterway roughly halfway between downtown Savannah and the Atlantic Ocean. The fortified house was part of a network of defensive structures established by James Oglethorpe, founder of Georgia, and early Georgia colonists to protect Savannah from a potential Spanish invasion. Jones subsequently developed Wormsloe into a small plantation, and his descendants built a large mansion at the site which they used as a country residence.The State of Georgia acquired the bulk of the Wormsloe Plantation in 1973 and opened it to the public as a state historic site in 1979.%0a%3c %0a%3c !!!The Mansion%0a%3c %0a%3c %25rfloat text-align=center margin-top=5px margin-right=0px margin-bottom=5px margin-left=15px%25http://wantonwicked.gamingsandbox.com/wiki/images/mta/locations/wormsloeplantation2.jpg%0a%3c The Mansion is certainly spacious enough for Savannah’s Consilium, luckily the Consilium does not meet that often. When it does, the staff is reduced, and those who remain are sleepwalkers often tied with the various orders. The bar is often self-serve, and the kitchen is closed after providing finger foods and hors d’oeuvres, cleanup is simple as each member of the Consilium is expected to police themselves, Southern manners and all. The Consilium is careful about its presence in the Mansion; the building is old, a history hidden in the woods.

Hidden away south of Savannah, the Wormsloe house is by the Consilium for an Occasional gathering, one that can host the various and numerous Awakened of the city. Not too far from the main house, nee mansion, is a private cemetery once used by the Jones family. This would not be of note, as many properties had private cemeteries back in the early colonial period, but the boundaries of the cemetery act as a Demense. It has been standing law that the area is left undisturbed in regards to the nature of the Demense, but it has been, at times, been used with the permission of the Hierarch, to practice, research, and experiment with arcana.%0a%3c %0a%3c !!!The Dueling House%0a%3c %0a%3c %25rfloat text-align=center margin-top=5px margin-right=0px margin-bottom=5px margin-left=15px%25http://wantonwicked.gamingsandbox.com/wiki/images/mta/locations/wormsloeplantation2.jpg %0a%3c Formal duels, accepted by multiple parties and with the permission of the Sentinels or the Consilium, have used this building on the former plantation’s main grounds for decades. The Dueling House, as it is known among the Awakened, was once a church on the Wormsloe Plantation. Even before its acquisition by the State of Georgia, this building had been the site of duels dating back to the early 20th century. The Consilium of Savannah, with the Plantation tenant’s unknowing permission and then with the state’s, has been using the former church for decades. First as a meeting place, and then as formal location for duels, the small building has seen the rise of the Savannah Consilium from the day its first stone was laid in a foundation. Some say the building is now haunted, no fewer than eight awakened have died fighting in this building.%0a%3c %0a%3c http://wantonwicked.gamingsandbox.com/wiki/images/mta/locations/wormsloeplantation4.jpg%0a%3c %0a%3c (Source: Wikipedia 14 Aug. 2013)%0a%3c %0a%3c 	%0a%3c [--%25color=#365776%25[[#top| Back to top]]--]%0a%3c %0a%3c [[#TPH]]%0a%3c !!The Pirate's House%0a%3c ''[[Players.MageOrders|Silver Ladder]], [[CityBook.MageSettingConsilium|Consilium]]''\\%0a%3c ''20 E.

It is thought[by whom?] to be the oldest standing building in the state of Georgia.%0a%3c %0a%3c It may not look like much on the outside, but the Pirate’s House has been seen more than a few days, more than a few faces, and has many secrets to tell. The wooden building, with washed out plank siding and simple post and lintel construction has been a mainstay of Savannah, for better or worse, since it first opened its doors in 1753. The Pirate House now is a popular tourist attraction, a pub and restaurant where one can come and get a meal and a drink in good company and the safety of friends.%0a%3c %0a%3c It wasn’t always that way.%0a%3c %0a%3c %25lfloat text-align=center margin-top=5px margin-right=15px margin-bottom=5px margin-left=0px%25http://wantonwicked.gamingsandbox.com/wiki/images/mta/locations/thepirateshouse2.jpg%0a%3c Back in the day the Pirate’s House had a different commodity that spirits and foods that it was famous for. Besides beer, food and wenches, the “Pirate House” did a brisk trade in something else; they found new sailors for the ships. Rather than going to all the trouble of convincing people of what a nice life it was at sea (people knew better) they simply kidnapped them.%0a%3c %0a%3c This entry, you see, was the dumping point for men who had drank to much, been roofied by the owners of the bar, or just beaten over the head with a cudgel if they were stubborn enough to resist the loaded drinks. The good news, you could never say that the beer was watered down, the bad news, you could say that once you found yourself in the middle of an ocean. Once dumped into the tunnels, like this one, %0a%3c %0a%3c %0a%3c %25lfloat text-align=center margin-top=5px margin-right=15px margin-bottom=5px margin-left=0px%25http://wantonwicked.gamingsandbox.com/wiki/images/mta/locations/thepirateshouse5.jpg%0a%3c Connect the Pirate’s house to hidden exit points along the Savannah. Unbeknownst to most people walking the street of Savannah, one of those tunnels still exists, connecting The Pirate’s House to Morrell Park, less than a quarter of a mile apart, one of the Ferry landings on the southern bank of the Savannah River. This is unknown to the sleepers, not so much to the Awakened.%0a%3c %0a%3c The Pirate house still has some of those rooms open so that customers can see what life could have been like in the part, of course, the Consilium has a different use for those tunnels. One of the basement tunnels has a warded passage, a wall that is solid and innocuous to a sleeper as they suddenly remember it was time to go and have another drink, another cigarette, any normal and mundane reason not to tarry to long beneath the pub. To a sleepwalker, the tunnel itself is… interesting, but in the way that gives an itch to the back of the neck, and a desire to go and get some fresh air. For the Awakened, heading to the tunnel leads them to a dead end with a simple wrought Iron door that is locked. Speaking a simple incantation, an Atlantean word of power, opens the lock on the iron grate and allows the Awakened to travel a bit lower into the belly of Savannah.%0a%3c %0a%3c %25lfloat text-align=center margin-top=5px margin-right=15px margin-bottom=5px margin-left=0px%25http://wantonwicked.gamingsandbox.com/wiki/images/mta/locations/thepirateshouse3.jpg%0a%3c Many have researched the iron gate, and while its metallurgical composition is nothing shocking, the spells cast on the item are impressive. Starting with a mask of normality that is consistently on, when High speech is uttered around the gate there is a triggered Sense consciousness before the gate then opens. As the gate opens it casts a, for lack of a better term, eternal now on any sleepers within the area, in the tunnels or directly about them. At the same time there is a temporary incognito presence and imposter cast on any awakened entering the gate. The combination works that the sleepers don’t see anyone passing through, forgetting the person there a minute ago, perhaps passing them off as a ghost… the building is haunted you know.%0a%3c %0a%3c The combination of spells at the iron gate was placed by a master Mastigos in the early 1900’s, back when there was a revitalized interest in the darker histories of Savannah coincided with Prohibition. The basement of the Pirate’s House was first converted into a speak easy, the Awakened just assumed ownership of this portion of the building, making people forget about its existence. The basement has draught beer and a liquor shelf as stocked as the one above them in the main premises. Sadly, there is no kitchen in the basement, so the bar usually has pre-made sandwiches and bar nuts ( yes, the bar nuts are always stale.)%0a%3c %0a%3c %25lfloat text-align=center margin-top=5px margin-right=15px margin-bottom=5px margin-left=0px%25http://wantonwicked.gamingsandbox.com/wiki/images/mta/locations/thepirateshouse4.jpg%0a%3c %0a%3c Since its inception, the Awakened have always been involved with the Pirate’s House in one way or another. Sometimes as staff, other times as managers and owners, the Awakened presence around the building has seeped into the frame. There is an overall positive vibe about the building, a distraction for those still asleep that allows them to relax, to enjoy. It allows for the Awakened to continue about their business with some freedom, and occasionally get a good buzz while doing it.%0a%3c %0a%3c The Pirate’s house has changed hands between orders several times, sometimes used as a bartering chip, other times as a marker on a debt, the current owners of the Pirate House are the Silver Ladder. They manage the location with the understanding that all mages are welcome at the location. The Pirate’s house is one of three known Demenses in Savannah and the surrounding area. %0a%3c %0a%3c !!!Rules when at the Pirate’s house:%0a%3c %0a%3c !!!!Mundane rules:%0a%3c *Men -No Shoes, no Shirt, No Service.%0a%3c *Women – No shirt, free drinks%0a%3c *No Firearms, knives, weapons, cudgels or anything that might go boom.%0a%3c *Always pay your tab.%0a%3c *Do not eat the big white breath mint.%0a%3c !!!!Supernal Rules:%0a%3c *Magic that influences another awakened or sleepwalker while in the boundaries of the Pirate’s House is forbidden.
