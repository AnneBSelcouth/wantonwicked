When gathering pieces for the Hedgespun piece, what matters is the story. This can be done before or during the creation; e.g. you can take scattered pieces from a storyline you’ve just been through and weave something from those, or you can determine what you want to make and set out to forge a storyline to create the piece. One piece is needed for each level of the Hedgespun; each representing a different challenge that was overcome (these challenges do not need to be combat, or even physical. A copy of a hard-won agreement, a drop of blood from the one who broke it and then the knife that ended him combine to make a perfectly acceptable Hedgespun). For book-keeping purposes, simply note what challenges were overcome (and copy/paste relevant thread entries if possible. It lets the STs see the overall result) and what items were used that were relevant to the challenges.%0a> >>%3c%3c%0a> ''Drawback:'' Cold Iron may destroy delicate Hedgespun garments, and it's not wise to let it touch sturdier Hedgespun, either...%0a> %0a> ''Hedgespun Raiment''%0a> %0a> This is being brought into line with other Hedgespun, as a 1-5 dot merit. A full suit of Hedgespun clothing is 1 dot, 1/2 armour is 2 dots, 2/3 armour is 3 dots. The additional effects in Rites of Spring may be bought. A person may only benefit from one suit of Hedgespun raiment at a time.%0a> %0a> ''Hedgespun Automata''%0a> Multiple people may pool their dots here. The rules as a whole follow Rites of Spring. Each character's dots in a particular automata max out at 5; you may, however, assist another in their work on an Automata you've invested into.%0a> %0a> ''Hedgespun Weapons''%0a> %0a> Due to the confusing rules in Rites of Spring, this is the ruling on Hedgespun Weapons.%0a> As with all Hedgespun, weapons operate on a 1-5 scale. All Hedgespun weapons begin at the basic stats for their type; size, durability, damage, applicability for fighting styles and so on. Each dot can then add to the weapon’s abilities as noted in Rites of Spring.%0a> %0a> !!!Note: The Toxicity aspect of Hedgespun is limited to one dot for items not directly acquired in ST-run scenes.%0a> %0a> ''Hedgespun Firearms''%0a> (:toggle hide gun:)%0a> >>id=gun border='0px solid #999'%3c%3c %0a> Replicating the effects of modern firearms technology in hedgespun is impossible, but provided that a smith is willing to cast an eye backward, functional guns and the like are quite attainable. Below are the stats available at each dot of Hedgespun for fire-arms. The gun's mask will almost always be archaic/simple, but the mien can be anything from a lazer pistol to a bazooka made from the femur of a giant.%0a> %0a> "Standard" ammunition can be related to the mien of the gun. The laser pistol might shoot jags of cold electricity, the bazooka hobgoblin skulls. The guns are considered "loaded" to capacity the first time they are used in a scene, and can be "re-loaded" with the expenditure of a point of Glamour and an instant action.%0a> %0a> HS Holdout Pistol (1L, Capacity 1, Range 10/20/39, Size 1) *\\%0a> HS Flintlock Pistol (1L, Capacity 2, Range 15/30/60, Size 2J or 2L) *\\%0a> HS Light Revolver (2L, Capacity 6, Range 15/30/60, Size 2J) * *\\%0a> HS Heavy Revolver (3L, Capacity 6, Range 25/50/100, Size 2L) * * *\\%0a> HS Light Rifle (3L, Capacity 2, Range 125/250/500, Size 3) * * *\\%0a> HS Heavy Rifle (4L, Capacity 2, Range 200/400/800, Size 3) * * * *\\%0a> HS Elephant Gun (5L, AP 1, Capacity 2, Range 250/500/1000, Size 4) * * * * *%0a> %0a> In addition to their 'normal' effect it is possible to add additional effects to the above weapons. Like when Hedgespinning melee weapons each additional effect raises the value of the item by one. Possible additional effects include bonuses to the user's initiative, defense, the addition of Toxicity to the weapon's bullets or significantly increasing the capacity of the weapon. %0a> %0a> It should be noted that the relative "weakness" of Hedgespun Firearms as compared to Hedgespun Weaponry is meant to portray the effects of the Hedge on technology, and also to serve as something of a stop-gap for the fact that Firearms rolls often negate Defense, which can be extremely significant in this venue.%0a> >>%3c%3c%0a> ''Hedgespun Bows & Crossbows''%0a> (:toggle hide bow:)%0a> >>id=bow border='0px solid #999'%3c%3c %0a> Bows and Crossbows are far simpler to spin than most firearms. Like their mundane equivelants they can be fired using either Athletics or Firearms and HS bows have a strength requirement equal to their damage rating. Unlike hedgespun guns these weapons require ammunition rather than activation with glamour and all forms of bows are assumed to come with a quiver of 12 arrows or bolts which, once used, may either be recovered or replaced. Replacement arrows and bolts may be crafted from the Thorns and expending a single point of glamour and passing a Wyrd+Crafts roll is sufficient to create up to six. Reloading a HS Crossbow or HS Pistol Crossbow is always an instant action while reloading other HS bows is an instant action unless either the weapon has the additional effect 'Swift Reload' or the character has Fighting Style: Archery.%0a> %0a> HS Small Bow (2L, Capacity 1, Range 3x(Strength+Athletics+5), Size 4) *\\%0a> HS Medium Bow (3L, Capacity 1, Range 4x(Strength+Athletics+5, Size 4) * *\\%0a> HS Giant Bow (4L, Capacity 1, Range 3x(Strength+Athletics+5), Size 4) * * *%0a> %0a> HS Pistol Crossbow (1L (AP1), Capacity 1, Range 15/30/60, Size 2N) *\\%0a> HS Crossbow (3L (AP2), Capacity 1, Range 40/80/160, Size 3) * *%0a> %0a> Like with hedgespun firearms and melee weapons it is possible for hedgespun bows and crossbows to have additional effects in addition to simply causing damage and each additional effective raises the value of the item by one. Possible additional effects include Swift Reload, bonuses to the user's initiative or defense or the addition of Toxicity to the weapon's arrows or bolts. Bows or Crossbows with additional effects require activation for the additional effects to apply but may be used without activating those effects.%0a> >>%3c%3c%0a> ''Trifle Tokens & Ammo''%0a> (:toggle hide ammo:)%0a> >>id=ammo border='0px solid #999'%3c%3c %0a> Trifle and Token ammunition can only be used in mundane guns and, as per the book, doing so requires activation - a point of glamour as a reflexive action. The point of glamour also ensures that for that particular shot the gun functions normally in the hedge. One brief note: as per Wanton Wicked house rules buying magic items which aren't player created costs XP which means that it costs 2xp per 3 trifles/shots.%0a> >>%3c%3c%0a> ''Hedgespun Oddities''%0a> %0a> These follow the rules in Rites of Spring.%0a> %0a> ''Hedge Cooking''%0a> %0a> Hedge Cooking%0a> (:toggle hide cooking:)%0a> >>id=cooking border='0px solid #999'%3c%3c %0a> Sort of a lesser version of hedgespinning, the art of producing palatable and even magical meals operates on generally different premises than any of the above.%0a> %0a> The first step involves coming to a recipe. Doing so involves an extended Int+Crafts+/-Modifier roll. Positive modifiers would include riffs on existing recipes (+1), recipes particularly related to Court/Seeming (+1, +2 if both), while negative would reflect the complexity of the dish (-1 for each hedge ingredient beyond the first, etc.). Creating a recipe for an item which has no affect beyond roleplaying (inducing an emotion, tasting like colors, etc.) requires 3 suxx on this roll. Creating a recipe that actually incorporates the effects of a goblin fruit requires 6 suxx. Creating a recipe that incorporates the effects of multiple goblin fruits requires 10 suxx. These rolls can be blue booked in your thread. If an existing goblin fruit matches the theme of the desired effect, it will be used; if not, a suitable ingredient will be identified by the ST.%0a> %0a> The second step involves getting the ingredients. Most often, this follows standard Hedge Gathering. Hunting Hedgebeasts or rarer fruits will require trips to the Highway, and thus, ST or GST interaction.%0a> %0a> The third step involves the actual cooking. The roll is extended, Int+Crafts+/-Modifiers, with each roll reflecting 15 minutes of preparation/cooking. Positive modifiers include a relative Workshop (+Rating), hedgespun cutlery (+Rating). Negative modifiers reflect the overall complexity of the dish (-1 for each magical ingredient). Successes required vary. An adequate dinner for four might require 3 suxx. A delicious dinner for two, 5 suxx, a banquet for twenty 10 suxx, and so on. %0a> %0a> Anything beyond these rules will qualify as hedgespinning, and almost anything imaginable is possible given the right ingredients or story. A bottle of wine that allows everyone who drinks it to recieve a cherished memory of the vintners choosing, animate lobsters that must be bested in a cutlery duel before submitting to being eaten, etc. Recipe, gathering, and creation will follow the standard rules for Hedgespinning.%0a> >>%3c%3c%0a> ''Experience Cost''%0a> (:toggle hide cost:)%0a> >>id=cost border='0px solid #999'%3c%3c %0a> Hedgespun items will no longer be free as standard. Crafted Hedgespun will have a per-dot discount at ST discretion for exceptional storytelling and significant challenges overcome; this discount can reduce the cost to zero.%0a> %0a> Hedgespun bought at the Goblin Market will cost full XP. Dots paid for may be held if a particular item is destroyed, and then a new item of the same type refunded at a later date (e.g. Saucy Sal has her prized salt-water sabre snatched from her scabbard by a slippery Scarecrow. The 3-dot merit is noted on her sheet; later, she purchases a new 3-dot Hedgespun Weapon from the Market, and pays no XP for it. If she instead bought a fine frock or interesting statuette, she would pay the XP for those).%0a> %0a> Note that as Hedgespun Raiment single items of clothing and Hedgespun Weapons without special abilities are 0 dots in the background, they cost no XP to buy at the Market.%0a> %0a> >>%3c%3c%0a> %0a> %0a> [[#Gathering]]%0a> '''Gathering in the Hedge'''%0a> %0a> [[http://www.wantonwicked.net/pmwiki/index.php?n=CityBook.TheHedge#Gathering|This section has been moved to The Hedge]]%0a> %0a> %0a> [[#Cultivating]]%0a> '''Cultivating & Hybridizing Goblin Fruit'''%0a> (:toggle hide fruit:)%0a> >>id=fruit border='0px solid #999'%3c%3c %0a> Rules regarding Cultivation and Hybridization of Hedge Bounty can be found starting on p. 128 of Rites of Spring.%0a> %0a> Cultivation requires one (or preferably, multiple) sample(s) of the fruit intended to be planted. It must then be "fed", according to the guidelines on p. 129. Both location for planting and method(s) of feeding attempted should be documented in your character thread, and the STs will relay the successfulness (or not) of the endeavors.%0a> %0a> Once a sample is planted and fed, a roll of Wits+Crafts is required, with bonuses or penalties at ST discretion (a relevant Workshop would be a bonus, an inadequate location a penalty). If successful, the plant will take root and mature in [7-Suxx] days, and begin to bear fruit in twice that time (minimum of one day and two days, respectively). If the roll is failed, it can be re-attempted the next day at a -1 penalty, with no further need for feeding.%0a> %0a> Hybridization follows the same process, but the Wits+Crafts roll suffers a -2 penalty in addition to any other, and combinations/effects will be determined by the ST team. Once established, they will be "fixed" and added to the wiki. Hybrids presented in RoS can be created by this method, or harvested in the Highways.%0a> %0a> >>%3c%3c%0a> [[#Glamour]]%0a> '''Glamour'''%0a> (:toggle hide glamour:)%0a> >>id=glamour border='0px solid #999'%3c%3c  %0a> Because we want glamour to matter more in this iteration of the game, we've decided to implement the following House Rules:%0a> %0a> Changelings will have an Average Glamour Pool (AGP), equal to 3 + Wyrd + Mantle + Harvest. To determine how much glamour you start off with each day, make a glamour harvesting roll and add the suxx to your AGP. You may choose to start with less glamour if you wish to, but you can never start with more. Further glamour may be gathered through IC action.%0a> %0a> The more glamour you choose to carry with you, the more noticable you are to the True Fae and their servants.

RoS notes that the resistance is reflexive, but under Werewolves it notes that both actions are, both perceiving and resisting. From this we conclude that Piercing the Mask with Mage Sight is an instant action. This is not a Scrutiny roll, and the Mage must have a reason to first suspect something is odd, i.e. have already realised the Changeling is strange via Scrutiny.%0a> %0a> >>%3c%3c%0a> [[#Hollows]]%0a> '''Hollows'''%0a> (:toggle hide hollow:)%0a> >>id=hollow border='0px solid #999'%3c%3c %0a> In keeping with the theme of Besieged, you may at times find your personal Hollow comes under attack. If you have more dots in any Hollow category (including Workshop and Archive) than you have dots in Wards, the richness of your Hollow may attract the attention of the greedy denizens of the Hedge. One of the STs may contact you to run a scene where your Hollow is attacked, and you will have a chance to repel the intruders. If you are unsuccessful, you may temporarily lose access to some of your Hollow dots until you can recover the assets that were lost or damaged in the assault.%0a> %0a> >>%3c%3c%0a> [[#Mantle]]%0a> '''Mantle & Goodwill'''%0a> (:toggle hide mantle:)%0a> >>id=mantle border='0px solid #999'%3c%3c %0a> Both Mantle and Court Goodwill may be temporarily suspended at ST discretion if they feel that you are not living up to the ideal of the Court, or the Court in question requests it for specific misdeeds. It will be up to you to earn their use again%0a> >>%3c%3c%0a> [[#Dreams]]%0a> '''Dreams & Oneiromancy'''%0a> (:toggle hide dreams:)%0a> >>id=dreams border='0px solid #999'%3c%3c  %0a> ''Entering Dreams''%0a> %0a> There are three ways to affect a dream that players have access to (barring Tokens or the like). Pledge, Dream 2, and Dreamwalking. Dreamwalking is always going to be a scene (it's simply too dangerous to be anything else), so let's look at these two.%0a> %0a> Dream 2 does not need that the Changeling has entered the dream. In fact, as they need to see the sleeper - they can't be in their dream. It allows the Changeling to set a dream in motion. However, as they are not actually within the Dream, they cannot create such things as Healing Dreams, Teaching Dreams - only dreams. They also cannot see the dream, and so cannot Learn About the Dreamer, and so on. As they are not present, any attacks against another dreamcreature may only be Environmental attacks, and they cannot block the invader from attacking the dreamer.%0a> %0a> To enter a dream, as per Changeling Core p193, the oneiromancer must make a Meditation Roll. They must be in the Hedge at the time; either a personal hollow or another spot (due to the potential dangers, the Freehold frowns on using the Commons) and enter a deep, meditative sleep. Each roll takes 30 minutes, and the roll is Wits+Composure, with Wyrd as an equipment bonus. That means no other equipment bonuses may be used. A changeling needs 8 successes to enter their own dreams, 12 to enter those of their Fetch, and 16 to enter one whom they are Dream-tasked to via a Pledge; this includes their own Motley.%0a> %0a> A storyteller may waive this roll if they so wish for a scene. A player may choose to skip this roll if the oneiromancer has an uninterrupted 8 hours in which to meditate; it is assumed that any oneiromancer will be able to gather the required number of successes within the 16 rolls they can make in 8 hours.%0a> %0a> ''Affecting the Dream''%0a> %0a> Firstly, the dream's '''Intensity''' must be noted. This is a Wits+Resolve roll on behalf of the Dreamer. Pages 193-195 Changeling Core make it clear this roll is not one the Changeling or other can choose to ignore; it is always rolled, and provides a penalty equal to the dream's Intensity to all rolls within the dream.%0a> %0a> Working changes to a dream involves a Wits+Empathy+Wyrd roll. There are two options - altering a dream in progress of scaping an entirely new one. Both have drawbacks.%0a> %0a> ''Riding'' the dream is simpler. There is no initial cost; the Oneiropomp simply rolls Wits+Empathy+Wyrd-Intensity to shape the dream. The dream may be Analysed, the dreamer Convinced, Learned About, undergo Psychotherapy, the Intensity scoured (but only once per dream), or dream poison sought. If any roll in this step achieves successes above the dream's Intensity - the dreamer awakens, though the oneiropomp may spend 1 WP to stop this happening. Scouring is the only exception to this; if the Intensity is scoured to below 1, the dreamer awakens instantly, and no WP may be spent to prevent it.%0a> %0a> ''Dreamscaping'' can only occur if there are no dreams in progress - usually the Dreamer scored 0 successes on their initial Intensity roll. Once that occurs, the Oneiropomp may spend 1 glamour roll Wits+Empathy+Wyrd, contested by the dreamer's Wits+Resolve (again, this contest is not optional. The psyche resists) with the one with most successes uses their '''''net''''' successes to create a dream of their choosing. If the Intensity was scoured to 1, this cost is doubled to 2 glamour. If the Intensity of the dream was scoured to 0 or lower, then the dreamer awakes and the whole process must begin again. Dreamscaping allows Healing Sleep, Stress Relief, Sleep Teaching - and Nightmares, if they wish.%0a> %0a> Sleep Teaching may only be used to teach Skills, Merits, and Contracts that the oneiromancer possesses - the oneiromancer cannot teach what they don't know. Skill Specialties may not be taught through Sleep Teaching. In order to gain the benefits of Sleep Teaching through threadwork, the oneiromancer must provide a brief description of the dream and explain how it helps the dreamer learn the Skill, Merit, or Contract. Some Merits will be harder to justify than others, and we will be looking particularly closely at the justifications for Sleep Teaching Merits that provide an item external to the dreamer. In addition to this description, the oneiromancer must provide links to all rolls: the Meditation rolls to enter the dream (if they had less than 8 uninterrupted hours to work), the dreamer's Intensity roll and the scouring roll (if they chose to scour the Intensity), the dreamscaping roll, and the dreamer's resistance roll (if they chose to dreamscape a fallow psyche.) %0a> %0a> ''Dreamwoven Vessels''%0a> %0a> An oneiromancer may craft a dream and store it in an item for later use. First, the oneiromancer selects an item appropriate to the kind of dream to be created. This item must be invested with a point of glamour, and within an hour of that, the oneiromancer must begin crafting the dream. Crafting the dream is an extended Int + Empathy + Wyrd roll, with each roll taking one day. The number of suxx scored on this roll acts as the dream's Intensity.%0a> %0a> Dreamwoven vessels may contain any of the kinds of dreams available through Dreamscaping, as well as Wyrd-dreams. Extended rolls for dreamweaving Sleep Teaching dreams must have a target number of at least 5 successes, and an exceptional success must be gained on the crafting roll in order for the dreamer to gain an experience point from the Sleep Teaching. Please see the section on Sleep Teaching above for additional rules clarifications. An oneiromancer crafting a Sleep Teaching dreamwoven vessel must provide a description of the dream it contains and explain how it helps the dreamer learn the Skill, Merit, or Contract. They must also provide links to their crafting rolls.%0a> %0a> Any dreamer may use a dreamwoven vessel, even one who is not Pledgebound to the oneiromancer. To experience the dream, the dreamer only needs to fall asleep with the object in contact with them. Their psyche does not contest the dream. If they are unaware of the vessel as the source of the strange dream however, the Intensity of the dream is opposed by the dreamer's Resolve + Composure roll.%0a> >>%3c%3c%0a> [[#Clarity]]%0a> '''Clarity'''%0a> %0a> The Clarity Break "killing a supernatural creature" includes Hedgebeasts and Hobs as long as the creature in question is sentient. Of course, in the Hedge, sentience from non-sentience isn't always easy to tell, which fits the unstable nature of Clarity very well. When in doubt (in terms of mechanics) assume that the creature is sentient.%0a

Certain Entitlements (e.g. Broken Bough) require Wyrd 2 or 3 and a number of other low-level skills. While feasible to begin as a member, the ST team must be in agreement that it is suitable, and your background and other statistics must support it. If the character is approved, they will be assumed to be a low-level member of the Entitlement, having entered into it comparatively recently.%0a%3c * Each level of Hedge-beast Companion. These are co-dependent creatures that bond with the Lost for mutual survival. As such, a medial Alliance pledge is encouraged. If the ST team feels that a hedge-beast is being abused or neglected, we will step in.%0a%3c * Token rated at 2+. Each dot of Token after the first is a Restricted Item.%0a%3c * New Identity 4 is a Restricted Item (and requires excellent justification).%0a%3c * More than 6 Trifles (p 209). Every 3 Trifles is considered 1 Dot of the Token Merit.%0a%3c * Merits from Goblin Markets are banned at character creation.%0a%3c * "Stripper" and other sex industry concepts are currently restricted. The venue has more than plenty of these. They may be allowed for a particularly good background and a player that has a solid grasp of what working in stripping and the sex industry is actually realistically like. We would advise against completely filling out and creating a sheet for such a concept before talking with a member of the Changeling team, and in general the concept is discouraged.%0a%3c %0a%3c '''Incentive XP'''\\%0a%3c ''Players may have a maximum of +5 Venue iXP and +5 WoD iXP at creation ''%0a%3c %0a%3c [--%25color=green%25[[#ctop| Back to top]]--]%0a%3c %0a%3c [[#HouseRules]]%0a%3c ->[+++'''House Rules'''+++]%0a%3c (:cellnr:) %0a%3c *[[#Tokens| Tokens]]%0a%3c *[[#Hedgespun| Hedgespun]]%0a%3c *[[#Gathering| Gathering in the Hedge]]%0a%3c *[[#Changes| Becoming a Changeling]]%0a%3c *[[#Cultivating| Cultivating & Hybridizing Goblin Fruit]]%0a%3c *[[#Glamour| Glamour]]%0a%3c *[[#MageSight| The Mask and Mage Sight]]%0a%3c *[[#Hollows| Hollows]]%0a%3c *[[#Mantle| Mantle & Goodwill]]%0a%3c *[[#Dreams| Dreams & Oneiromancy]]%0a%3c *[[#Clarity| Clarity]]%0a%3c (:tableend:) %0a%3c %0a%3c %0a%3c [[#Tokens]]%0a%3c '''Tokens'''%0a%3c %0a%3c The rules for Token-making are to be found in Rites of Spring. The Token Maker merit is required. Swiftly, it is an extended roll of Wyrd +Crafts +Bonuses. 1 Glamour point is needed per roll, and up to 4 extra glamour can be spent per roll for extra successes. 25 successes are needed per dot of Token, and the rule for extended rolls is in effect (i.e. total number of rolls is Wyrd +Crafts).%0a%3c %0a%3c Note that making tokens takes 8 hours per day for an extended period of time; it is effectively a full time job. If you are making Tokens, maintaining a mortal life and job can be difficult.%0a%3c %0a%3c Tokens may also be bought at the Goblin Market.%0a%3c %0a%3c  %0a%3c [--%25color=green%25[[#ctop| Back to top]]--]%0a%3c %0a%3c [[#Hedgespun]]%0a%3c '''Hedgespinning'''%0a%3c %0a%3c Hedgespun falls into a number of broad categories. The same basic system is in place for each; a Wits +Crafts roll, extended, with an hour per roll and 3 successes needed per level in the Hedgespun. If you are spinning in a Hollow, please note that down as well as the level of the Wards.%0a%3c %0a%3c ''Gathering Nuts in May''%0a%3c %0a%3c Or indeed, gathering anything at anytime. When gathering pieces for the Hedgespun piece, what matters is the story. This can be done before or during the creation; e.g. you can take scattered pieces from a storyline you’ve just been through and weave something from those, or you can determine what you want to make and set out to forge a storyline to create the piece. One piece is needed for each level of the Hedgespun; each representing a different challenge that was overcome (these challenges do not need to be combat, or even physical. A copy of a hard-won agreement, a drop of blood from the one who broke it and then the knife that ended him combine to make a perfectly acceptable Hedgespun). For book-keeping purposes, simply note what challenges were overcome (and copy/paste relevant thread entries if possible. It lets the STs see the overall result) and what items were used that were relevant to the challenges.%0a%3c %0a%3c ''Drawback:'' Cold Iron may destroy delicate Hedgespun garments, and it's not wise to let it touch sturdier Hedgespun, either...%0a%3c %0a%3c ''Hedgespun Raiment''%0a%3c %0a%3c This is being brought into line with other Hedgespun, as a 1-5 dot merit. A full suit of Hedgespun clothing is 1 dot, 1/2 armour is 2 dots, 2/3 armour is 3 dots. The additional effects in Rites of Spring may be bought. A person may only benefit from one suit of Hedgespun raiment at a time.%0a%3c %0a%3c ''Hedgespun Automata''%0a%3c %0a%3c Multiple people may pool their dots here. The rules as a whole follow Rites of Spring. Each character's dots in a particular automata max out at 5; you may, however, assist another in their work on an Automata you've invested into.%0a%3c %0a%3c ''Hedgespun Weapons''%0a%3c %0a%3c Due to the confusing rules in Rites of Spring, this is the ruling on Hedgespun Weapons.%0a%3c As with all Hedgespun, weapons operate on a 1-5 scale. All Hedgespun weapons begin at the basic stats for their type; size, durability, damage, applicability for fighting styles and so on. Each dot can then add to the weapon’s abilities as noted in Rites of Spring.%0a%3c %0a%3c Note: The Toxicity aspect of Hedgespun is limited to one dot for items not directly acquired in ST-run scenes.%0a%3c %0a%3c ''Hedgespun Firearms''%0a%3c %0a%3c Replicating the effects of modern firearms technology in hedgespun is impossible, but provided that a smith is willing to cast an eye backward, functional guns and the like are quite attainable. Below are the stats available at each dot of Hedgespun for fire-arms. The gun's mask will almost always be archaic/simple, but the mien can be anything from a lazer pistol to a bazooka made from the femur of a giant.%0a%3c %0a%3c "Standard" ammunition can be related to the mien of the gun. The laser pistol might shoot jags of cold electricity, the bazooka hobgoblin skulls. The guns are considered "loaded" to capacity the first time they are used in a scene, and can be "re-loaded" with the expenditure of a point of Glamour and an instant action.%0a%3c %0a%3c HS Holdout Pistol (1L, Capacity 1, Range 10/20/39, Size 1) *\\%0a%3c HS Flintlock Pistol (1L, Capacity 2, Range 15/30/60, Size 2J or 2L) *\\%0a%3c HS Light Revolver (2L, Capacity 6, Range 15/30/60, Size 2J) * *\\%0a%3c HS Heavy Revolver (3L, Capacity 6, Range 25/50/100, Size 2L) * * *\\%0a%3c HS Light Rifle (3L, Capacity 2, Range 125/250/500, Size 3) * * *\\%0a%3c HS Heavy Rifle (4L, Capacity 2, Range 200/400/800, Size 3) * * * *\\%0a%3c HS Elephant Gun (5L, AP 1, Capacity 2, Range 250/500/1000, Size 4) * * * * *%0a%3c %0a%3c In addition to their 'normal' effect it is possible to add additional effects to the above weapons. Like when Hedgespinning melee weapons each additional effect raises the value of the item by one. Possible additional effects include bonuses to the user's initiative, defense, the addition of Toxicity to the weapon's bullets or significantly increasing the capacity of the weapon. %0a%3c %0a%3c It should be noted that the relative "weakness" of Hedgespun Firearms as compared to Hedgespun Weaponry is meant to portray the effects of the Hedge on technology, and also to serve as something of a stop-gap for the fact that Firearms rolls often negate Defense, which can be extremely significant in this venue.%0a%3c %0a%3c ''Hedgespun Bows & Crossbows''%0a%3c %0a%3c Bows and Crossbows are far simpler to spin than most firearms. Like their mundane equivelants they can be fired using either Athletics or Firearms and HS bows have a strength requirement equal to their damage rating. Unlike hedgespun guns these weapons require ammunition rather than activation with glamour and all forms of bows are assumed to come with a quiver of 12 arrows or bolts which, once used, may either be recovered or replaced. Replacement arrows and bolts may be crafted from the Thorns and expending a single point of glamour and passing a Wyrd+Crafts roll is sufficient to create up to six. Reloading a HS Crossbow or HS Pistol Crossbow is always an instant action while reloading other HS bows is an instant action unless either the weapon has the additional effect 'Swift Reload' or the character has Fighting Style: Archery.%0a%3c %0a%3c HS Small Bow (2L, Capacity 1, Range 3x(Strength+Athletics+5), Size 4) *\\%0a%3c HS Medium Bow (3L, Capacity 1, Range 4x(Strength+Athletics+5, Size 4) * *\\%0a%3c HS Giant Bow (4L, Capacity 1, Range 3x(Strength+Athletics+5), Size 4) * * *%0a%3c %0a%3c HS Pistol Crossbow (1L (AP1), Capacity 1, Range 15/30/60, Size 2N) *\\%0a%3c HS Crossbow (3L (AP2), Capacity 1, Range 40/80/160, Size 3) * *%0a%3c %0a%3c Like with hedgespun firearms and melee weapons it is possible for hedgespun bows and crossbows to have additional effects in addition to simply causing damage and each additional effective raises the value of the item by one. Possible additional effects include Swift Reload, bonuses to the user's initiative or defense or the addition of Toxicity to the weapon's arrows or bolts. Bows or Crossbows with additional effects require activation for the additional effects to apply but may be used without activating those effects.%0a%3c %0a%3c ''Trifle Tokens & Ammo''%0a%3c %0a%3c Trifle and Token ammunition can only be used in mundane guns and, as per the book, doing so requires activation - a point of glamour as a reflexive action. The point of glamour also ensures that for that particular shot the gun functions normally in the hedge. One brief note: as per Wanton Wicked house rules buying magic items which aren't player created costs XP which means that it costs 2xp per 3 trifles/shots.%0a%3c %0a%3c ''Hedgespun Oddities''%0a%3c %0a%3c These follow the rules in Rites of Spring.%0a%3c %0a%3c ''Hedge Cooking''%0a%3c %0a%3c Hedge Cooking%0a%3c %0a%3c Sort of a lesser version of hedgespinning, the art of producing palatable and even magical meals operates on generally different premises than any of the above.%0a%3c %0a%3c The first step involves coming to a recipe. Doing so involves an extended Int+Crafts+/-Modifier roll. Positive modifiers would include riffs on existing recipes (+1), recipes particularly related to Court/Seeming (+1, +2 if both), while negative would reflect the complexity of the dish (-1 for each hedge ingredient beyond the first, etc.). Creating a recipe for an item which has no affect beyond roleplaying (inducing an emotion, tasting like colors, etc.) requires 3 suxx on this roll. Creating a recipe that actually incorporates the effects of a goblin fruit requires 6 suxx. Creating a recipe that incorporates the effects of multiple goblin fruits requires 10 suxx. These rolls can be blue booked in your thread. If an existing goblin fruit matches the theme of the desired effect, it will be used; if not, a suitable ingredient will be identified by the ST.%0a%3c %0a%3c The second step involves getting the ingredients. Most often, this follows standard Hedge Gathering. Hunting Hedgebeasts or rarer fruits will require trips to the Highway, and thus, ST or GST interaction.%0a%3c %0a%3c The third step involves the actual cooking. The roll is extended, Int+Crafts+/-Modifiers, with each roll reflecting 15 minutes of preparation/cooking. Positive modifiers include a relative Workshop (+Rating), hedgespun cutlery (+Rating). Negative modifiers reflect the overall complexity of the dish (-1 for each magical ingredient). Successes required vary. An adequate dinner for four might require 3 suxx. A delicious dinner for two, 5 suxx, a banquet for twenty 10 suxx, and so on. %0a%3c %0a%3c Anything beyond these rules will qualify as hedgespinning, and almost anything imaginable is possible given the right ingredients or story. A bottle of wine that allows everyone who drinks it to recieve a cherished memory of the vintners choosing, animate lobsters that must be bested in a cutlery duel before submitting to being eaten, etc. Recipe, gathering, and creation will follow the standard rules for Hedgespinning.%0a%3c %0a%3c ''Experience Cost''%0a%3c %0a%3c Hedgespun items will no longer be free as standard. Crafted Hedgespun will have a per-dot discount at ST discretion for exceptional storytelling and significant challenges overcome; this discount can reduce the cost to zero.%0a%3c %0a%3c Hedgespun bought at the Goblin Market will cost full XP. Dots paid for may be held if a particular item is destroyed, and then a new item of the same type refunded at a later date (e.g. Saucy Sal has her prized salt-water sabre snatched from her scabbard by a slippery Scarecrow. The 3-dot merit is noted on her sheet; later, she purchases a new 3-dot Hedgespun Weapon from the Market, and pays no XP for it. If she instead bought a fine frock or interesting statuette, she would pay the XP for those).%0a%3c %0a%3c Note that as Hedgespun Raiment single items of clothing and Hedgespun Weapons without special abilities are 0 dots in the background, they cost no XP to buy at the Market.%0a%3c %0a%3c  %0a%3c [--%25color=green%25[[#ctop| Back to top]]--]%0a%3c %0a%3c [[#Gathering]]%0a%3c '''Gathering in the Hedge'''%0a%3c %0a%3c [[http://www.wantonwicked.net/pmwiki/index.php?n=CityBook.TheHedge#Gathering|This section has been moved to The Hedge]]%0a%3c %0a%3c  %0a%3c [--%25color=green%25[[#ctop| Back to top]]--]%0a%3c %0a%3c [[#Cultivating]]%0a%3c '''Cultivating & Hybridizing Goblin Fruit'''%0a%3c %0a%3c Rules regarding Cultivation and Hybridization of Hedge Bounty can be found starting on p. 128 of Rites of Spring.%0a%3c %0a%3c Cultivation requires one (or preferably, multiple) sample(s) of the fruit intended to be planted. It must then be "fed", according to the guidelines on p. 129. Both location for planting and method(s) of feeding attempted should be documented in your character thread, and the STs will relay the successfulness (or not) of the endeavors.%0a%3c %0a%3c Once a sample is planted and fed, a roll of Wits+Crafts is required, with bonuses or penalties at ST discretion (a relevant Workshop would be a bonus, an inadequate location a penalty). If successful, the plant will take root and mature in [7-Suxx] days, and begin to bear fruit in twice that time (minimum of one day and two days, respectively). If the roll is failed, it can be re-attempted the next day at a -1 penalty, with no further need for feeding.%0a%3c %0a%3c Hybridization follows the same process, but the Wits+Crafts roll suffers a -2 penalty in addition to any other, and combinations/effects will be determined by the ST team. Once established, they will be "fixed" and added to the wiki. Hybrids presented in RoS can be created by this method, or harvested in the Highways.%0a%3c %0a%3c  %0a%3c [--%25color=green%25[[#ctop| Back to top]]--]%0a%3c %0a%3c [[#Glamour]]%0a%3c '''Glamour'''%0a%3c %0a%3c Because we want glamour to matter more in this iteration of the game, we've decided to implement the following House Rules:%0a%3c %0a%3c Changelings will have an Average Glamour Pool (AGP), equal to 3 + Wyrd + Mantle + Harvest. To determine how much glamour you start off with each day, make a glamour harvesting roll and add the suxx to your AGP. You may choose to start with less glamour if you wish to, but you can never start with more. Further glamour may be gathered through IC action.%0a%3c %0a%3c The more glamour you choose to carry with you, the more noticable you are to the True Fae and their servants. Luckily, the converse is also true. If you have...%0a%3c %0a%3c More than 3/4 of your max glamour: The True Fae and their servants get a +3 on rolls to detect you.%0a%3c From 1/4 to 3/4 of your max glamour: No effect.%0a%3c Less than 1/4 of your max glamour: The True Fae and their servants get a -3 on rolls to detect you.%0a%3c %0a%3c  %0a%3c [--%25color=green%25[[#ctop| Back to top]]--]%0a%3c %0a%3c [[#MageSight]]%0a%3c '''The Mask and Mage Sight'''%0a%3c %0a%3c Resisting is reflexive for the Changeling, but the mage's roll is an instant action. RoS notes that the resistance is reflexive, but under Werewolves it notes that both actions are, both perceiving and resisting. From this we conclude that Piercing the Mask with Mage Sight is an instant action. This is not a Scrutiny roll, and the Mage must have a reason to first suspect something is odd, i.e. have already realised the Changeling is strange via Scrutiny.%0a%3c %0a%3c  %0a%3c [--%25color=green%25[[#ctop| Back to top]]--]%0a%3c %0a%3c [[#Hollows]]%0a%3c '''Hollows'''%0a%3c %0a%3c In keeping with the theme of Besieged, you may at times find your personal Hollow comes under attack. If you have more dots in any Hollow category (including Workshop and Archive) than you have dots in Wards, the richness of your Hollow may attract the attention of the greedy denizens of the Hedge. One of the STs may contact you to run a scene where your Hollow is attacked, and you will have a chance to repel the intruders. If you are unsuccessful, you may temporarily lose access to some of your Hollow dots until you can recover the assets that were lost or damaged in the assault.%0a%3c %0a%3c  %0a%3c [--%25color=green%25[[#ctop| Back to top]]--]%0a%3c %0a%3c [[#Mantle]]%0a%3c '''Mantle & Goodwill'''%0a%3c %0a%3c Both Mantle and Court Goodwill may be temporarily suspended at ST discretion if they feel that you are not living up to the ideal of the Court, or the Court in question requests it for specific misdeeds. It will be up to you to earn their use again%0a%3c %0a%3c  %0a%3c [--%25color=green%25[[#ctop| Back to top]]--]%0a%3c %0a%3c [[#Dreams]]%0a%3c '''Dreams & Oneiromancy'''%0a%3c %0a%3c ''Entering Dreams''%0a%3c %0a%3c There are three ways to affect a dream that players have access to (barring Tokens or the like). Pledge, Dream 2, and Dreamwalking. Dreamwalking is always going to be a scene (it's simply too dangerous to be anything else), so let's look at these two.%0a%3c %0a%3c Dream 2 does not need that the Changeling has entered the dream. In fact, as they need to see the sleeper - they can't be in their dream. It allows the Changeling to set a dream in motion. However, as they are not actually within the Dream, they cannot create such things as Healing Dreams, Teaching Dreams - only dreams. They also cannot see the dream, and so cannot Learn About the Dreamer, and so on. As they are not present, any attacks against another dreamcreature may only be Environmental attacks, and they cannot block the invader from attacking the dreamer.%0a%3c %0a%3c To enter a dream, as per Changeling Core p193, the oneiromancer must make a Meditation Roll. They must be in the Hedge at the time; either a personal hollow or another spot (due to the potential dangers, the Freehold frowns on using the Commons) and enter a deep, meditative sleep. Each roll takes 30 minutes, and the roll is Wits+Composure, with Wyrd as an equipment bonus. That means no other equipment bonuses may be used. A changeling needs 8 successes to enter their own dreams, 12 to enter those of their Fetch, and 16 to enter one whom they are Dream-tasked to via a Pledge; this includes their own Motley.%0a%3c %0a%3c A storyteller may waive this roll if they so wish for a scene. A player may choose to skip this roll if the oneiromancer has an uninterrupted 8 hours in which to meditate; it is assumed that any oneiromancer will be able to gather the required number of successes within the 16 rolls they can make in 8 hours.%0a%3c %0a%3c ''Affecting the Dream''%0a%3c %0a%3c Firstly, the dream's '''Intensity''' must be noted. This is a Wits+Resolve roll on behalf of the Dreamer. Pages 193-195 Changeling Core make it clear this roll is not one the Changeling or other can choose to ignore; it is always rolled, and provides a penalty equal to the dream's Intensity to all rolls within the dream.%0a%3c %0a%3c Working changes to a dream involves a Wits+Empathy+Wyrd roll. There are two options - altering a dream in progress of scaping an entirely new one. Both have drawbacks.%0a%3c %0a%3c ''Riding'' the dream is simpler. There is no initial cost; the Oneiropomp simply rolls Wits+Empathy+Wyrd-Intensity to shape the dream. The dream may be Analysed, the dreamer Convinced, Learned About, undergo Psychotherapy, the Intensity scoured (but only once per dream), or dream poison sought. If any roll in this step achieves successes above the dream's Intensity - the dreamer awakens, though the oneiropomp may spend 1 WP to stop this happening. Scouring is the only exception to this; if the Intensity is scoured to below 1, the dreamer awakens instantly, and no WP may be spent to prevent it.%0a%3c %0a%3c ''Dreamscaping'' can only occur if there are no dreams in progress - usually the Dreamer scored 0 successes on their initial Intensity roll. Once that occurs, the Oneiropomp may spend 1 glamour roll Wits+Empathy+Wyrd, contested by the dreamer's Wits+Resolve (again, this contest is not optional. The psyche resists) with the one with most successes uses their '''''net''''' successes to create a dream of their choosing. If the Intensity was scoured to 1, this cost is doubled to 2 glamour. If the Intensity of the dream was scoured to 0 or lower, then the dreamer awakes and the whole process must begin again. Dreamscaping allows Healing Sleep, Stress Relief, Sleep Teaching - and Nightmares, if they wish.%0a%3c %0a%3c Sleep Teaching may only be used to teach Skills, Merits, and Contracts that the oneiromancer possesses - the oneiromancer cannot teach what they don't know. Skill Specialties may not be taught through Sleep Teaching. In order to gain the benefits of Sleep Teaching through threadwork, the oneiromancer must provide a brief description of the dream and explain how it helps the dreamer learn the Skill, Merit, or Contract. Some Merits will be harder to justify than others, and we will be looking particularly closely at the justifications for Sleep Teaching Merits that provide an item external to the dreamer. In addition to this description, the oneiromancer must provide links to all rolls: the Meditation rolls to enter the dream (if they had less than 8 uninterrupted hours to work), the dreamer's Intensity roll and the scouring roll (if they chose to scour the Intensity), the dreamscaping roll, and the dreamer's resistance roll (if they chose to dreamscape a fallow psyche.) %0a%3c %0a%3c ''Dreamwoven Vessels''%0a%3c %0a%3c An oneiromancer may craft a dream and store it in an item for later use. First, the oneiromancer selects an item appropriate to the kind of dream to be created. This item must be invested with a point of glamour, and within an hour of that, the oneiromancer must begin crafting the dream. Crafting the dream is an extended Int + Empathy + Wyrd roll, with each roll taking one day. The number of suxx scored on this roll acts as the dream's Intensity.%0a%3c %0a%3c Dreamwoven vessels may contain any of the kinds of dreams available through Dreamscaping, as well as Wyrd-dreams. Extended rolls for dreamweaving Sleep Teaching dreams must have a target number of at least 5 successes, and an exceptional success must be gained on the crafting roll in order for the dreamer to gain an experience point from the Sleep Teaching. Please see the section on Sleep Teaching above for additional rules clarifications. An oneiromancer crafting a Sleep Teaching dreamwoven vessel must provide a description of the dream it contains and explain how it helps the dreamer learn the Skill, Merit, or Contract. They must also provide links to their crafting rolls.%0a%3c %0a%3c Any dreamer may use a dreamwoven vessel, even one who is not Pledgebound to the oneiromancer. To experience the dream, the dreamer only needs to fall asleep with the object in contact with them. Their psyche does not contest the dream. If they are unaware of the vessel as the source of the strange dream however, the Intensity of the dream is opposed by the dreamer's Resolve + Composure roll.%0a%3c  %0a%3c [--%25color=green%25[[#ctop| Back to top]]--]%0a%3c %0a%3c [[#Clarity]]%0a%3c '''Clarity'''%0a%3c %0a%3c The Clarity Break "killing a supernatural creature" includes Hedgebeasts and Hobs as long as the creature in question is sentient. Of course, in the Hedge, sentience from non-sentience isn't always easy to tell, which fits the unstable nature of Clarity very well.
