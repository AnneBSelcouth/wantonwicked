The island's natural resources remain as they may have been before the arrival of Europeans, never cleared to make way for human expansion and greed.%0a%0aSince 1969, Wassaw has been considered a wildlife sanctuary for migratory birds and loggerhead sea turtles. The refuge's ten thousand acres include tidal marshes, two lesser islands and several small hammocks. Less than thirty percent of the refuge is maritime forest, mudflats, and sandy beach, the greater portion being tidal salt marshes. The northern beach is eroding away, giving a sense of it being a "boneyard beach" where the growth there has died away leaving sun bleached skeletons of old trees.%0a%0aThe abundance of wildlife on Wassaw include over 200 species of birds, including egrets, herons, as well as osprey and southern bald eagles. Alligators reside by the dozens in the freshwater sloughs and ponds, where waterfowl also spend the fall and winter. It isn't uncommon to see bottle-nose dolphins in the surrounding waters, and beginning in the spring more than eighty loggerheads nest on Wassaw.%0a>>frame width=465px%3c%3c%0ahttp://wantonwicked.gamingsandbox.com/wiki/images/city/si1.jpg http://wantonwicked.gamingsandbox.com/wiki/images/city/si2.jpg http://wantonwicked.gamingsandbox.com/wiki/images/city/si3.jpg%0aWassaw Island Forest, Fort Morgan, Boneyard Beach%0a>>%3c%3c%0a!!District Features:%0a>>lrindent frame border='1px solid #898989' bgcolor=#eeeeee padding=15px%3c%3c%0a'''City/Mortal''':%0a>>%3c%3c%0a%0a>>lrindent frame border='1px solid #005826' bgcolor=#eeeeee padding=15px%3c%3c%0a'''Changeling''':%0a>>%3c%3c%0a%0a>>lrindent frame border='1px solid #003471' bgcolor=#eeeeee padding=15px%3c%3c%0a'''Mage''':%0a>>%3c%3c%0a%0a>>lrindent frame border='1px solid #9e0b0f' bgcolor=#eeeeee padding=15px%3c%3c%0a'''Vampire''':%0a* Domain of [[http://wantonwicked.gamingsandbox.com/wiki/index.php?n=Players.CharlesHollingshead|Charles Hollingshead, Circle of the Crone]]%0a* Location Rating: 3%0a>>%3c%3c%0a%0a>>lrindent frame border='1px solid #74483f' bgcolor=#eeeeee padding=15px%3c%3c%0a'''Werewolf''':%0a>>%3c%3c%0a%0a!!District Locations:%0a(:sortable align=center:)%0a||class=sortable id=SILocations%0a||!Location||!Venue||!Owner||%0a||[[CityBook.TheLandingsClubofSkidawayIsland|The Landings]]||[[CityBook.CityBook|Any]]||None||%0a(:tableend:)%0a%0a----%0a(:include CityBook.Directory:)
