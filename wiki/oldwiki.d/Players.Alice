She's got blond hair that tends to hang past her shoulders...if she doesn't have it up or pushed out of the way in some manner or the other. She wears simple clothes: jeans, t-shirts. Occasionally she wears short dresses or club wear. Whatever the case, she seems ready to go from interview to club--and go right back to it when she wants. Most of the time she speaks with a thick accent that is hard to understand at first, as if it was missing parts of the sound, giving away her hearing impaired abilities.%0a%0ahttp://i.imgur.com/8HI4p3J.png%0a-> As the spell is casted the sounds of a sonic boom style base hits the system around her radiating off like giant sound waves that slide away from her person out over the world around her.
