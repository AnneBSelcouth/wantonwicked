Going from a skull faced sullen figure with snowy white when engaging in some of the more serious mageish affairs to a dark haired young woman in her mid twenties. Her slender frame complimented with toned muscle and a agile form. Its obvious she keeps herself in good shape for whatever it is she does for a living and for the Pentacle at large.-]%25%25%0a%3c %0a%3c %25left%25http://img825.imageshack.us/img825/329/1t4q.jpg%0a%3c ->[-%25color=#6F5753%25 Smoke has a checkered past amongst the mages of the Atlantean orders.

This coupled with her membership in the whipping boys of the Adamantine Order haven't painted a very good picture for this young mage. But it is known she seeks redemption not only for the Oakland massacre but for the deaths of her own family claimed to be at the hands of James Carver as well. -]%0a%3c %0a%3c %25%25http://img23.imageshack.us/img23/2258/zug5.jpg%0a%3c *[-%25color=#6F5753%25'''Adamantine Arrow''' - A Neophyte and member of the Whipping Boys of San Francisco comes with a certain reputation among the order.
