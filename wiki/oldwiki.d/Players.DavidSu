He left SCAD with a master's degree in luxury and fashion management and took a stylist job at ''South'' magazine. A little over two years ago he opened a highly exclusive boutique in Midtown with a large and well-heeled client base from the start.%0a%0aHis embrace, which came at the hands of an Invictus harpy named Nadine Grondin, happened shortly afterwards, while on a trip home to Montreal. Upon return to Savannah, David chose to throw his lot in with the Carthian Movement instead. He had been a relatively quiet member of the covenant until Clara Phizer appointed him as her legate.%0a[[%3c%3c]]%0a%0a%25lfloat text-align=center margin-top=5px margin-right=5px margin-bottom=5px margin-left=0px width=400 newwin%25http://img199.imageshack.us/img199/5958/rs7v.jpg%0a%25width=300%25http://wantonwicked.gamingsandbox.com/wiki/images/vtr/headers/vtr_rph.png%0a'''What's Su?''' ([[http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1eYniuuyydY| "Rich bitches whose faces have been pulled so tight they can't see what they're buying"]]) - David is the owner of Su, a boutique in Midtown. All customers are introduced by a mutual friend - and arrive by appointment only - to receive the exclusive attention of the staff. The philosophy at Su is that, in today’s world of fads and trends, we have become overburdened by choice. Therefore, customers can find an ever-changing treasure trove of the most on-trend beauty products, fine wines and spirits, essential books, homeware, fashions, accessories, jewellery and more at Su, but each range is limited to a few items, carefully selected by David for you. Well, not ''you''.%0a%0a'''Walker''' (High Society) - Walkers are an endangered species, but in some of the wealthiest pockets of the world, they still thrive. ''Everbody'' in Savannah's old guard knows David - he's the fellow who entertains your wife when you can't be bothered. Though nobody mentions it, they all know he's a homosexual and so nothing untoward is going on. He's not an official member of the club and he never will be, but the ladies enjoy him and the men are grateful to him.%0a%0a'''Legate''' (Carthians) - David assists the Myrmidon, Clara Phizer, in an investigative capacity. It's no secret that he is a Lynx or that the Lynx have some kind of facility with networks. It's fair to assume that his bloodline is what prompted Phizer to snap him up. He's not exactly a hard-boiled detective, after all.%0a%0a'''"Quality" Gossip''' (Invictus) - Though he's a confirmed Carthian, David enjoys spending time with kindred of quality - members of the First Estate. For him, being at an Invictus soirée is like stepping into an episode of ''Downton Abbey'' and he can't get enough of it. He seems to know a lot of the jargon, too, and actually enjoys using the proper terms of address - his sire is Unconquered and they're still on good terms.%0a[[%3c%3c]]%0a%0a%25%25http://wantonwicked.gamingsandbox.com/wiki/images/vtr/headers/vtr_con.png%0a* [[Clara Phizer]]: Boss%0a[[%3c%3c]]%0a%25%25http://wantonwicked.gamingsandbox.com/wiki/images/vtr/headers/vtr_q.png%0a* "A man with so many questions who has a job to seek answers.
