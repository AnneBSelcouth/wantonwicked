She's got blond hair that tends to hang past her shoulders...if she doesn't have it up or pushed out of the way in some manner or the other. She wears simple clothes: jeans, t-shirts. Occasionally she wears short dresses or club wear. Whatever the case, she seems ready to go from interview to club--and go right back to it when she wants.
