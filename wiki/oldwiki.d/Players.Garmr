There is a roundshaped small scar on her forehead further marring the potential pretty looks in an eerie way; some may recognize a scar from a bullet when they see it.

She Awakened at an age of 14 and has been drilled and trained by the Order of the Adamantine Arrow ever since. When she was ready and mature enough to speak her own mind she officially joined the Order and also her Master Nattvis cabal.  Last year tragically Garmr's cabal was betrayed by one of its own members to the Seers and wiped out of existence. Nattvis once stayed in Savannah and it is from his records Garmr is taking the same journey to a different Savannah to study sculpting at the Art and Design College and gather knowledge and training from the Arrow organization of Savannah.%0a---%0a> ''Place your Public History Here''%0a

When she smiles there is a cute dimple in her cheek furthering the paradox of this young woman. There is a roundshaped small scar on her forehead further marring the potential pretty looks in an eerie way; some may recognize a scar from a bullet when they see it. There is a modest chest not much to speak of and a selfconfident straight stance. Often wearing old worn jeans, tank tops, sneakers and hoodies in solemn black or grey.''%0a---%0a> ''Place your Description Here''%0a41c41%0a%3c ''Shadows enhances, looming near and the smell of gravedirt grown lush on dead bodies.''%0a---%0a> ''Nimbus description here''%0a
