Her eyes are still piercing, but are a stark blue white in color, she almost invokes the image of a ghost in her mien, and in the right light seem takes on a translucent look, allowing light and shawod to pass through her body.''%0a---%0a> ''Mien: As a 'human' Adri is a tall, and statuesque Hispanic woman with piercing eyes, and long black hair that she either keeps highly styled, or pulled tightly into a tail at the back of her head. In most circumstances Adri dresses in tailored and well fitted suits.''%0a52,56c50%0a%3c ''Mortician (All): Adri literally deals with the dead. Bodies to be more precise. From the moment a death is reported to her, her or her business step in and take care of the deceased from the police report to the grave.%0a%3c %0a%3c Speaker for the Dead (Supernatural): Sometimes, on those rare occasions, Adri will say or do things that seem to be directives from beyond the grave. From finding lost items only the dead knew of, to anonymously reporting crimes to the authorities that lead to the close of a murder case. IN the right circles, and approached correctly, Adri can be convinced to seek out and speak to the ghosts of the dead.%0a%3c %0a%3c Justice (Criminal): Adri has been 'caught' a few times following criminals, and in one case even trying to cut the manhood off of one. Are you into drugs, bribery, or other non-violent malfeasance? Adri doesn't seem to care, extortion. Bullying, rape? Or worse murder? You may find the pretty girl in your rear veiw mirror at the most inopportune times''%0a---%0a> ''Place your Role Playing Hooks, Ways others can interact with you, here.''%0a
