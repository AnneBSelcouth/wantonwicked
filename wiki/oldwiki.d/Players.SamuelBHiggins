It was on a cool early spring afternoon that Sam B. came across the pack, preparing to run for their lives. They had packed everything they needed and were loading it into their car. Sam, usually not one to cross boundaries, had come to check on their well-being and to make sure that the pack was still breathing. At first, they thought he was Anshega as well, but when that dissipated, Sam offered to help them load their truck to head out. That was about the time the first Anshega scout made the mistake of being seen. Sam B. was never one to pull punches, and since the other Uratha hadn't noticed the skulking Predator King, Sam B. took matters in his own hands and gave chase. He took down the foe, and beat him to a bloody pulp. In the end, he allowed his escape, hoping that the message would come across that a fearless Meninna was now protecting the young pack. %0a%0aNo such luck.%0a%0aAs the group loaded the last box into the caravan, the Anshega stepped up, blocking the road. Four of them, with two wolf-blooded holding shotguns. Though Sammy B. will always play the story down, the truth of the matter is that he sood between the Anshega and the young Uratha pack, taking silver buckshot and being left for dead in order to allow the other pack to escape. And that is how Jazmijn and Sam B. met, but that is another story altogether.''%0a%0a'''Glory: &#9679; Cunning: &#9679;'''%0a''Jasper, Alabama; 2011 - Anshega, again. Attacking, and winning. In Sam's travels, he has helped many werewolves that may or may not have deserved the assistance. This is one of those times that only Elolunim speak of, and in hushed tones even then. From what his Choir speaks of, there was an attack on several Uratha packs, leaving their territory and their packs decimated, leaving many dead. In order to thwart the attack, Sam B. provoked the Anshega just before their final assault, and outmaneuvered their ranks as they gave chase. He lead them into traps, snares and pitfalls until, finally, he lead the last three over a cliff. The one remaining Anshega he bested in one on one combat, effectively defeating one of the strongest Anshega packs in Alabama, single-handedly. ''%0a%0a'''Honor: &#9679;'''%0a''Sacremento, CA; 2009 - While passing through the foothills, Sam B. passed through contended territory. He happened upon a wolf who thought he was a new pack member of the "enemy" of the time, and attacked him. Sam, while defending himself, explained that he was just a traveler, but that he could probably help the situation. He took it upon himself to traverse between pack lines, at great peril to himself, to settle the dispute over borders and territory with an outcome that each pack could not only agree with, but benefit from. He also played a key role in setting up a Tur at their borders so that they would be able to settle disputes in a reasonable manner from that time on.''%0a%0a'''Honor: &#9679;&#9679;'''%0a'' Los Angeles, CA; 2010 - In the midst of his travels, Sam B. came to know the California packs rather well.

Where the pack would, at one time, show mercy even to the Anshega, they now seemed to be falling under the persuasion of the Storm Lord Cahalith. So, as Meninna are wont to do, he investigated. At great peril to himself, he followed the Cahalith to blasted lands, and found him meditating with a Maeljin. Not unwise, he sought his way back to safe territory and, when the time came, he told the pack what he had seen but only in the presence of the Cahalith himself. It was then that the Cahalith attacked Sammy. The pack itself had decided that whoever would win the fight, would be correct in the matter and it would be decided in that way. In true combat, and true challenge, Sam B. bested the Cahalith without slaying him, bound him and showed his pack the blasted lands that he had seen the Cahalith enter.
