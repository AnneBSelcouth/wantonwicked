A long lived life of a Renaissance man and artist from one passion to the next, though the details are sparing and if it is true, it is stranger than fiction.%0a%0aHe's clever for sure, but for as long a history as he claims, his history among the Awakened seems much shorter and fraught with questions, contradictions, and gaps. Savannah's Guardians needed bodies, for better or for worse, and Giallo's is as warm as the next. Since his arrival, he has made himself quite at home, and seems intent to get to the divine work of nosing into other willworkers' business in due course.%0a[[%3c%3c]]%0a%0ahttp://wantonwicked.gamingsandbox.com/wiki/images/mta/headers/mta_rph.png%0a* '''Hound of Flowers''' (Any) - Giallo is an obsessive personality, and a professional voyeur. He seeks out the strange and freakish, and then to record it, manipulate it, and finally edit it. There is a mixture of both fascination and desire to reshape the world in such an image, and thus it is not unlikely to find him in a porn shop, a rotary club, a peep show, or an airport. Anyone with Fame, Striking Looks, or other immediately noteworthy qualities can become in a moment his newest muse, though rarely does it seem obvious when his gears change.%0a* '''Cave Shadow''' (Any) - Damien Gennaro is a obscure true crime novelist that appeared about five or so years ago, documenting the infamous Hollywood murder of C-list celebrity Annabelle Parker. The level of detail and depth of the investigation was immense, but the actual work was dense and nearly incomprehensible. More sensational and amateur authors leapfrogged that effort and became famous and reignited the national phenomenon of that murder. A similar pattern repeated itself in California, and now in Savannah, as he seems to have relocated. Shrouded in a similar Pynchon-esque mystique, Damien Gennaro has no appearances or publicity but only a small, devoted group of similarly dangerously obsessed fans, true crime sleuths, and other authors looking for sources for their own work. Perhaps you are one of those fans of vicarious, sensational murder?%0a* '''Master of Dust''' (Film/Fame/Any) - Ted Denzyl was a actor in various B-rate films during the 80's, first as an extra and then in supporting roles, often in horrors or comedies but always second-rate, especially towards the direct-to-video phase. A character actor with no real staying value, he seems to have disappeared in the 90's from the silver screen, though in the yellow tabloids of Hollywood he maintained some notoriety and seemed to have far more connections than his fame should have allowed. Those with ties to the industry, a specific interest, or even Encyclopaedic Knowledge might notice a peculiar resemblence between the B-movie actor, and the willworker known as Giallo.%0a* '''Crown of Eyes''' (Police/Media) - There is an unknown source used by certain local rags to get information directly on police, especially homicide, investigations that is called "Deep Red" and is mainly monopolized by one metro editor by the name of Bernie Meyer. He has an intimate knowledge of a lot of what's going on that has always been confirmed as true by police press releases without fail, which has led to the idea that the leak is internal, which is a concern for the Internal Affairs division, among other watchdogs.%0a* '''Good Death''' (Guardians of the Veil) Giallo is a cleaner, like most Inheritors. Like most cleaners (and Inheritors), he is equally as talented as he is insufferable in this way, though his services are freely available to his fellow Visus Draconis. He is just as willing to assist rather than take over, but he has a very exacting mind and methodology that often works best when allowed to do his thing without interruption or interference. His philosophy is that it is better not to simply pretend that a crime did not exist, but to twist it into a story so sensational and engrossing that the lie being told is one that people ''want'' to be true, exploiting the puerile fantasies of the general public to his advantage.%0a[[%3c%3c]]%0ahttp://wantonwicked.gamingsandbox.com/wiki/images/mta/headers/mta_con.png%0a[[Ligeia|http://i.imgur.com/SvkAi7R.png"Ligeia"]]%0a[[%3c%3c]]%0ahttp://wantonwicked.gamingsandbox.com/wiki/images/mta/headers/mta_q.png%0a"''I've always believed in the magic of movies, and to me, the magic of movies is connected to thirty five millimeter. Everyone thinks, and you can't help but think, that when you are filming something that you are recording movement. You're not recording movement. You're just taking a series of still pictures. There's no movement in movies at all, but when shown at twenty frames per second through a light bulb, it creates the ''illusion'' of movement. So thus, when you are watching a movie, a film print, you are watching an illusion, and that is the magic of movies.''" - '''Quentin Tarantino'''%0a%0a* "''Everything is fiction.

More sensational and amateur authors leapfrogged that effort and became famous and reignited the national phenomenon of that murder. A similar pattern repeated itself in California, and now in Savannah, as he seems to have relocated. Shrouded in a similar Pynchon-esque mystique, Damien Gennaro has no appearances or publicity but only a small, devoted group of similarly dangerously obsessed fans, true crime sleuths, and other authors looking for sources for their own work. Perhaps you are one of those fans of vicarious, sensational murder?%0a%3c * '''Master of Dust''' (Film/Fame/Any) - Ted Denzyl was a actor in various B-rate films during the 80's, first as an extra and then in supporting roles, often in horrors or comedies but always second-rate, especially towards the direct-to-video phase. A character actor with no real staying value, he seems to have disappeared in the 90's from the silver screen, though in the yellow tabloids of Hollywood he maintained some notoriety and seemed to have far more connections than his fame should have allowed. Those with ties to the industry, a specific interest, or even Encyclopaedic Knowledge might notice a peculiar resemblence between the B-movie actor, and the willworker known as Giallo.%0a%3c * '''Crown of Eyes''' (Police/Media) - There is an unknown source used by certain local rags to get information directly on police, especially homicide, investigations that is called "Deep Red" and is mainly monopolized by one metro editor by the name of Bernie Meyer. He has an intimate knowledge of a lot of what's going on that has always been confirmed as true by police press releases without fail, which has led to the idea that the leak is internal, which is a concern for the Internal Affairs division, among other watchdogs.%0a%3c * '''Good Death''' (Guardians of the Veil) Giallo is a cleaner, like most Inheritors. Like most cleaners (and Inheritors), he is equally as talented as he is insufferable in this way, though his services are freely available to his fellow Visus Draconis. He is just as willing to assist rather than take over, but he has a very exacting mind and methodology that often works best when allowed to do his thing without interruption or interference. His philosophy is that it is better not to simply pretend that a crime did not exist, but to twist it into a story so sensational and engrossing that the lie being told is one that people ''want'' to be true, exploiting the puerile fantasies of the general public to his advantage.%0a---%0a> ''Place your Role Playing Hooks, Ways others can interact with you, here.''%0a53d40%0a%3c %0a57d43%0a%3c %0a59c45%0a%3c "''I've always believed in the magic of movies, and to me, the magic of movies is connected to thirty five millimeter. Everyone thinks, and you can't help but think, that when you are filming something that you are recording movement. You're not recording movement. You're just taking a series of still pictures. There's no movement in movies at all, but when shown at twenty frames per second through a light bulb, it creates the ''illusion'' of movement. So thus, when you are watching a movie, a film print, you are watching an illusion, and that is the magic of movies.''" - '''Quentin Tarantino'''%0a---%0a> ''What Others have to Say about you''%0a
