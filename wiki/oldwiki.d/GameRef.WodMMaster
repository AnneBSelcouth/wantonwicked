text=Setting Content%0a[[#Law]]%0a%0a!Laws of Georgia%0aThe laws of the setting will closely match those of the actual Savannah, Georgia. Information posted here shall therefore mostly regard commonly-used information by PCs (e.g. weapon laws) and the enforcement of law in the setting.%0a(WIP)%0a!!Weapon Laws & Notes%0aFor a full list of the laws, unabridged and with clarifying/simplifying annotations in italics, [[http://www.georgiapacking.org/law.php|click here]]. Reading the entire page is advised, as the sections below do not contain all of the finer details.%0a!!!Licensing%0a%0aThe license you're looking for is called a Georgia Weapons Carry License (WCL/GWL). It allows characters to carry most guns or knives (even above 5 inches) in most places freely.%0a%0aLicenses aren't needed for possession of most weapons or for carrying/using them for regular activities like hunting and fishing. However, they are needed for carrying everywhere else. Licenses last for 5 years, are very cheap (under $100), and must be carried while carrying as the license allows.%0a%0aApplicants must be non-felons of at least 21 years and, in the 5 years before applying and without further supervision/restraint, not have previously been in trouble for weapon violations, controlled-substance-related crimes, or been hospitalized for mental health, alcohol, or drug treatment/rehab.%0a%0a!!!Registration%0aIt's not necessary to register weapons, but that may affect the legality of some weapons.%0a%0a!!!Legality%0aSingle-shot and (short) burst-fire guns are legal to possess without a license, as are knives up to 5 inches.%0a%0aGeorgians may own automatic, sawed-off, and "dangerous" weapons (e.g. bazookas, grenades, mortars) as well as silencers if they're fully registered. However, Georgians are not allowed to carry or transport them anywhere and it would be fairly easy to track down usage, so shoot rockets around at your own risk.%0a%0a!!!Carrying%0aOpen carry of legal weapons is allowed during proper activities (fishing, hunting, etc) without a license. A carry license is required to openly carry in other places.%0a%0aWeapons are not allowed in government buildings, courthouses, jails, places of worship, mental health facilities that admit unwilling patients, nuclear power plants, 150 feet of polling stations, and bars unless the owner gives permission (mostly to the public rather than specific individuals; consider bars to admit guns unless otherwise noted.)%0a%0aSome jobs allow carrying pistols while on the job (police, investigators, judges, etc, see here for a full list) as long as the caliber is no larger than .357 for revolvers and .45 for autoloaders.%0a%0a!!!Self-Defense%0aUse of deadly force is allowed under specific circumstances including defense of the self or others from felonies or death, or one's habitation (dwellings, motor vehicles, or places of business). Keep in mind that this doesn't mean that characters cannot be arrested or brought to court, only that they have a legal defense. Also, keep in mind that unreasonable force may influence or negate this defense.%0a%0a!!!Weapon Identification%0aUnusual weaponry is easier to identify, especially in the case of guns. Some calibers dominate civilian domain so much that using them makes it almost impossible to track, while using others may make it much easier. Pistols are typically .22, .25, .32, .357, and 9mm; shotguns are almost always .410 or 12 gauge; rifles have more variance but are typically .22 for varmints or between .243 and .308 for hunting.%0a%0a!!!Hassles Of Carrying%0aRegardless of the laws, keep in mind that most people are not expressly aware of all of these laws and many do not agree with them; in fact, some are downright alarmist about it. As a result, characters who open-carry weapons may be periodically hassled by civilians and police for doing so, and sometimes the police are called to check that the carrier is following the law. Carrying may also affect interpretations of situations, especially if they involve aggression; for example, "... with a weapon" charges are typically tacked on to cases whether they're true or not, to add additional fires for defense lawyers to put out.%0a%0a!!Enforcement%0aThe laws of Georgia are specific. The enforcement, however, is not. Legally speaking, it's mostly a matter of who gets caught, what their social standing is, and how aggressive or skilled the lawyers are on both sides.%0aThe same laws, even with established precedents, can end up with totally different rulings and sentences in court for any number of reasons in the course of legal proceedings.%0a%0a!!!Confrontation%0aPolice may not always confront people committing minor crimes unless they affect others (e.g. open theft, violence), involve illegal weapons, or are called out to handle it. Most NPCs won't consider the risk worth the reward or the paperwork to take down smokers, small-time drug dealers, or simple traffic violators.%0a%0a!!!Response Times%0aResponse times greatly vary depending on many factors including time, area, and the importance of named individuals (if any). Many calls will take between 30 minutes and a couple hours to respond to unless the crime is extremely dangerous or imminent, in which case it may still take between 5 and 15 minutes.%0a%0a!!!Pursuit%0aThe police of Savannah are generally apathetic and ineffective. Offenders who flee fast enough (or flee at all, for some officers), don't have very specifically distinguishing characteristics, and don't leave a lot of evidence are likely to escape pursuit and investigation from most regular NPCs. Pursuit from PCs and the occasional NPC may supersede this, however.%0a%0a!!!Use Of Force%0aDue to the many cries of "wolf," claims of police brutality or overuse of force are rarely taken seriously unless it causes permanent debilitation in some way, or the right strings are violently tugged.%0a[[#LawEnd]]%0a%0a[[#History]]%0a!History%0aIn 1773, General James Oglethorpe and 120 passengers of the good ship “Anne” landed on a bluff along the Savannah River. Oglethrope named the 13th and final American colony “Georgia” after England’s King George II, Savannah became its first city.%0a%0aSavannah initially began as a colony which allowed free worship, but banned rum, lawyers and slavery. The city offered a new start for England’s working poor and strengthened the colonies by increasing trade. Additionally, it was chartered as a buffer zone for South Carolina protecting it from the advancement of the Spanish in Florida.%0a%0aThe beginning of Savannah’s history was peaceful, as Oglethorpe had received permission from the local Yamacraw Native Americans to settle in the area now known as Savannah. Due to the lack of warfare, Savannah flourished. As America’s first planned city, the city boasts 22 of the 24 original city squares.%0a%0aThe peace within Savannah was shattered during 1778, which it was held by the British until 1782. In 1792, a land-sea force of French and Americans tried to retake the city, but failed. After regaining its independence, Savannah once again flourished, and farmers found that the soil was rich with minerals and the climate was favorable for cultivation of rice and cotton. Plantations of slavery soon became highly profitable systems amidst Georgia and Carolina. During this time, Savannah worked as a port for the trans-Atlantic slave trade.%0aWith their new found wealth by cotton, residents built lavish homes and churches throughout the city. After the invention of the cotton gin outside of Savannah, the city rivalled Charleston as a commercial port. But misfortune struck in 1796 and 1820 as half of Savannah burned in ashes, both times.%0a%0aThe serenity within Savannah was destroyed with the start of the civil war. During the war, the city suffered from sea blockades so strict that the economy crumbled. “Impregnable” Fort Pulaski, was captured by Union soldiers in 1862. The city itself did not fall until mid-December, after General William Tucemseh burned down the city of Atlanta. On December 22nd, 1864, the General sent President Abraham Lincoln a telegram, offering the city as a Christmas present.%0a%0aAfter the Civil War, the Reconstruction period began. Food was scarce as the economy remained in ruins. During this time, freed slaves who remained in Savannah built a thriving community, with its own churches, schools and economic strength. Savannah became one of the most historically significant African-American cities in the nation. At the turn of the 20th century, cotton, resin and lumber became economically strong once again. Unfortunately, during the Great Depression an infestation of boll weevils came and destroyed most of these crops, alongside the state’s economy.%0a%0aIn today’s world, Savannah is a strong city with a diverse economy of manufacturing, hospitality, industry, military, high education, health care and retail. A tourist attraction, in 2008, more than 6.15 million people stayed in the city and spent more than 1.9 billion. In 2004, retail sales totalled more than 4.5 billion.%0a%0aSavannah is also home to Savannah State University, one of America’s oldest African-American universities, the acclaimed Savannah College of Art and Design, and 8 more universities. In addition, its home to one of the largest south-east seaports and works as a distribution point for a 26-state region, and 75 percent of the country.

Coille members are taken from the Blackroot Coalition, a group of eco-activists who work in secret and sometimes against the law.

They vye to reach the true heights of power that each individual can attain in their field ("realm") of choice, guided by intense heraldric totemism that glorifies their desired traits and focuses them into an image and legacy. To each Sovereign, every interaction is a struggle for dominance, and everything is a bargaining tool. All that ever matters is power: how much you have, how much you can get, and how much you can use. The internal structures of the Sovereigns constantly shift as a result of all the power-brokering and backstabbing that comes from these struggles, but they are nonetheless forces to be reckoned with. The only ties that bind them are a short list of rules called the Empyreal Accord, and the sheer power they all share.%0a%0aJoining the Sovereigns involves being sponsored and taught by another Sovereign to respect power first and foremost. After a degree of zealotry is proven, the initiate chooses a totem, makes a crest, then performs a short ritual (ask for details) and presentation of their crest to the other Sovereigns.%0a%0a:Totem & Crest: Each Sovereign designs their own personal crest based on a totem animal of their choice, whether it's a living creature, an extinct one, or a mythological being. They characterize their totem however they wish, so long as it exemplifies the sort of power they seek; a wolf or bull might be chosen by a ruthless corporate CEO, while a bat or mouse might be chosen by backroom dealer in secrets.%0a[[#C-ESEnd]]%0a!!!Storyteller Characters%0a*[[Players.AlbertWainwright|Albert Wainwright]]: The Golden Eagle (Cult Leader)%0a*[[Jasmine Miller]]: The Whispering Bat (Intelligence Specialist)%0a*[[Kevin Barnes]]: The Mad Wolf (Blood Vice Gang Leader)%0a[[#C-ESOOC]]%0a!!!OOC Information: Empyreal Sovereigns%0aThis is a Reason and Forbidden Lore organization.

Originally share-croppers, lured over towards the humid climate from England with the promises of fertile land and a break from the classicist world of London, The Spiveys have no stories of glory, like their counterparts, but they do have a history.%0aHalf of the Spiveys went for the Civil War, vetting on the Confederates and losing their lives. The other half stayed in Savannah and almost fled out of the state when they heard about Atlanta burning. The only reason they dared to stay was in desire of watching the destruction of the slave holding rich. And sure, the rich did suffer for an awful few years, but when the reconstruction was “finished” and the county elect was brought into place, all of those old families with their slave owning names fell into their places of affluency once again, but this time in positions of government and authority. Meanwhile, the Spiveys had a handful of confederate bill-folds, worth nothing, and not even an acre of land to cultivate.%0aThey moved into Savannah, without much else of anywhere to settle and have spent almost 200 years, fighting for their damned survival.%0aDue to a lack of money, terrible luck and their overall spite for the world, the Spiveys have always found themselves in the worst kind of underworld businesses. From small time gambling dens, to prostitution and all the way to meth production, the Spiveys are a legacy their own in entire Savannah.%0aAt current, they control a small portion of meth production and pill farma, but inevitably, they’ll have to move onto something else whenever the long arm of the law finds them. Most of the male Spiveys have been to prison, and many of the women have been in jail so often that the cops know them by name.

Individual perceptions of how that occurs change rapidly between members (some are powerful speakers while others are eco-terrorists) but each does their part and feels the same synergy with each other and the world itself.%0a%0aTheir initiates are drawn through two sub-organizations which partially act as fronts to the higher organization. Coille members are taken from the Blackroot Coalition, a group of eco-activists who work in secret and sometimes against the law.

They vye to reach the true heights of power that each individual can attain in their field ("realm") of choice, guided by intense heraldric totemism that glorifies their desired traits and focuses them into an image and legacy. To each Sovereign, every interaction is a struggle for dominance, and everything is a bargaining tool. All that ever matters is power: how much you have, how much you can get, and how much you can use. The internal structures of the Sovereigns constantly shift as a result of all the power-brokering and backstabbing that comes from these struggles, but they are nonetheless forces to be reckoned with. The only ties that bind them are a short list of rules called the Empyreal Accord, and the sheer power they all share.%0a%0aJoining the Sovereigns involves being sponsored and taught by another Sovereign to respect power first and foremost. After a degree of zealotry is proven, the initiate chooses a totem, makes a crest, then performs a short ritual (ask for details) and presentation of their crest to the other Sovereigns.%0a%0aTotem & Crest: Each Sovereign designs their own personal crest based on a totem animal of their choice, whether it's a living creature, an extinct one, or a mythological being. They characterize their totem however they wish, so long as it exemplifies the sort of power they seek; a wolf or bull might be chosen by a ruthless corporate CEO, while a bat or mouse might be chosen by backroom dealer in secrets.%0a%0a!!!OOC Information%0a!!!!Empyreal Sovereign NPCs:%0a*[[Players.AlbertWainwright|Albert Wainwright]]: The Golden Eagle (Cult Leader)%0a*[[Jasmine Miller]]: The Whispering Bat (Intelligence Specialist)%0a*[[Kevin Barnes]]: The Mad Wolf (Blood Vice Gang Leader)%0a%0a!!!!How to become involved:%0aMake one!

Or at least movies, namely, The Garden of Good and Evil. Its history is saturated with the sins of slavery, a nation divided in war and a culture of adversity. In its modern history, Savannah Georgia elected its first female mayor, Susan Weiner (R), in 1992, which helped herald a change to the cities political landscape. Soon after, the cities first African American mayor, Floyd Adams Jr (D) was elected in 1996, and at current the city has had 17 year long streak of Democrat African American mayors, including the current mayor Edna Jackson, who is also the first female African American mayor. %0a%0aSavannah has utilized the council/manager form of government since 1954. The council/manager form of city government is constructed of a city council which includes the mayor and eight alderman, six of which are elected from one of the six aldermanic districts. The other two members and the mayor are elected at-large. %0a%0aThe role of the city council is to enact levies and ordinances as well as adopt the annual budget and appoint the City Manager. Meanwhile, the City Manager enacts the policies and programs established by council, as well as recommends an annual budget and work programs. Additionally, the City Manager appoints bureau and department heads and exercises general supervision and control over the city employees.%0a%0a'''Mayor:''' Elizabeth Jackson%0a%0a'''City Manager:''' Christina Hutcheson %0a%0a'''Post 1 At-Large''': Cecelia Dell%0a%0a'''Post 2 At-Large''': Lawrence Mayville%0a%0a'''District 1''': Jordan Creighton%0a%0a'''District 2''': Ann Shirley%0a%0a'''District 3''': Kevin Burk%0a%0a'''District 4''': Mina Sanders%0a%0a'''District 5''': Dr. Rita Marshall%0a%0a'''District 6''': Wendy Nowling%0a %0a[--%25color=#365776%25[[#top| Back to top]]--]%0a[[#POEnd]] %0a-----%0a[[#Media]]%0a!!Media%0a%25width=650px%25http://i.imgur.com/4jT9nPm.jpg%0a'''Media Theme:'''  Technology marches to the beat of a war drum and threatens the traditions of print media. Every lens is focusing, and every revealed story leaks more of the unfathomable truth. %0a%0aFor nearly 200 years, Savannah has relied on print media as its primary source. The printing press, in the hands of the affluent few, was the sole producer of the cities only newspapers. As a consequence, a monopoly of news agencies took hold of the city. Information was controlled by an exclusive hierarchy of journalists and their editors, and in turn, a mirage of truth was cultivated on the front pages of these newspapers. %0a%0aThe 21st century has given way to a new technology, the internet, which contests the antiqued hold that these companies maintain within Savannah. Already, the venerable Savannah Evening News has fallen, and its sister newspaper, The Savannah Morning News, finds its subscription base falling. In an attempt of siphoning the hemorrhaging, the newspaper has attempted to modernize itself, to present a sleeker and younger appearance. %0a%0aIn conjunction to the threat that is the internet, technology continues to march forward. With the advancement of cell phones and digital cameras, it’s difficult to control the torrent of information before it reaches the blogs and indie media found on the internet.  The thick and dusty curtain within Savannah is peeling back with every amateur photographer, with every truth seeker, and soon the hidden belly of the city will be revealed. All it takes is the right shot, the right story, and the right place at the right time. %0a%0a'''Current News Agencies:'''%0a%0a*Savannah Morning News %0a%0a*DoSavannah %0a%0a[--%25color=#365776%25[[#top| Back to top]]--]%0a[[#MediaEnd]]%0a-----%0a[[#HS]]%0a!!High Society%0a%25width=650px%25http://i.imgur.com/O1EWkKh.png%0a'''Theme:''' History carries a haunting permanence within the boundaries of Savannah. Reminders of it cultivate a dogmatic society of tradition, splintered by the families who try to bury the shame of their past, and the families who exalt within it. %0aIn ages past, Savannah was a city of Southern romantic tradition, with all of the trappings that came with it. Southern Belles were debuted in lavish displays of affluence; the landed gentry cultivated a theatrical ideal of honor, even going so far as to adopt the Code Duello to enact their vengeance. Monied family names became legacies of tradition and legend, while their prejudices continued to divide a city and world.%0a%0aThough the preserved streets of Savannah are left unchanged, the cultural landscape of the city is transforming. Legacies fueled by their old money are finding their gilded cages cracking as a new generation of affluence rises into the upper echelons of their world. Beneath the veneer of polite society hides the menacing world of haughty gossip and deadly rivalries. The upcoming conflicts of Savannah’s society will dictate whether tradition is proven to be long lasting, if it can evolve for a changing world or if it will be torn asunder by the future.%0a%0aMembers of High Society will not only need to navigate the treacherous dangers of their entangled world, but also have to face the challenges beseeched upon them by an increasingly obsessed world of hungry paparazzo’s and a voyeuristic world that is continuously waiting for their slip up.%0a%0a[--%25color=#365776%25[[#top| Back to top]]--]%0a[[#HSEnd]]%0a-----%0a[[#Medical]]%0a!!Medical%0a%25width=650px%25http://i.imgur.com/1unGCz1.png%0a%0a'''Theme:''' Within the stark white walls of Savannah’s hospitals, the legendary battle of Salvation and Finality continue to clash.

The struggle to survive and thrive is a delicate and dangerous balance, with the threat of destruction on all sides. Leave the glam at the door and pick up something heavier: the streets don't have time for the weak.%0a%0a'''Summary:'''%0a%0aThe gangs of Savannah are almost evenly spread, but the violence never ends. Whether desperation or greed, the push for more, more, more leads to shady business and midnight sins. The Bloods and the Crips fight out their war with two large sets each, but hidden in the cracks and the unclaimed streets lie pockets of resistance and camaraderie that individually threaten the footholds and expansions of both as they seek their own niches.%0a%0a[--%25color=#365776%25[[#top| Back to top]]--] %0a-----%0a[[#GAEnd]]%0a[[#BL]]%0a!Bloods%0a**[[#BV|Blood Vices]]%0a**[[#SP|Sons of Piru]]%0a%0a[[#BV]]%0a'''Blood Vices'''%0a%0a'''Nicknames:''' ''Vices, V's, Blood Hounds.''%0a%0aThe Blood Vices are the strongest set of the Bloods, and hold the east with sheer power. They began small just 15 years ago from the fractured remains of other crews in the 80's, and under the leadership of the Mad Wolf they've made a huge comeback in the past 7-8 years. Becoming official Bloods is a newer development, as of 2010.%0a%0aWhat they have now was won with blood and sweat in outright war with the Mad Wolf on the front line. Their territory isn't the largest, but it's by far the most violently held, a fact that keeps them tightly knit and their enemies wary. Some long-standing survivors of other gangs, including some Bloods before the Vices shook hands with them, still bear the "wolf bite" scars of the Mad Wolf's signature weapon (and sometimes a grudge to match.) Though the violence in Blood Vice territory has gone down in recent years, the zeal of the Blood Vices hasn't ever faltered - they've just run out of people to fight.%0a%0aTheir empire is built on drugs. Most of it's just weed and dashes of half-cut coke to yuppie kids that want to feel a rush of fear-laced adrenaline after a sale and say they're edgy, but they deal in purer cocaine and heroin beyond that. Some Vices may sell a greater variety through their list of contacts, though that's on a strictly individual level. For some cases and causes, as approved by the Mad Wolf, they also sell their services to protect people, places, and things, particularly in their territory but not limited to it.%0a%0aThe Blood Vice colors are the traditional red of the Bloods, with a preference for white or gray as an off-color. Their tags vary, but stylized blood droplets, literal vices, or canine features typically mark their areas. The dog-paw trio of cigarette burned scars that some Bloods wear across the nation can be found somewhere on each and every Blood Vice, as a sign of solidarity and kinship to both the Bloods and the Mad Wolf himself. They favor weapons with points and hooks to leave gouging scars and torn corpses. Though relatively unused, pliers and bench-mounted vices are used to leave crushed, useless fingers or even limbs when the Blood Vices are particularly incensed. Despite these preferences, they still use straight blades for their initiation: drawing the blood of someone else (unwilling and unaware) through a full-force slash or stab.%0a%0a'''Leader:''' Kevin Barnes ''(The Mad Wolf)''%0a[[#BVEnd]]%0a%0a[--%25color=#365776%25[[#top| Back to top]]--] %0a-----%0a%0a[[#SP]]%0a%0a'''Sons of Piru'''%0a%0a'''Nicknames:''' ''Sons, Old Bloods.''%0a%0aIf there was ever such a thing as noblity in the Bloods, the Sons would be close. Though they take whomever they can recruit, the old guard of the Sons of Piru are the children of gang members, and some even claim blood to the original Pirus that eventually became the Bloods. It's only true for one particular Son, but nobody cares. The gesture's really just a declaration of will and bond, and the only thing that really matters is tough blood and tough skin.%0a%0aOn the gang scene, the Sons are survivors. Whatever's been thrown at them and their predecessors, they've lived through it all in some form or another. There's a long history that nobody cares to hear but everyone understands, even if they don't know the stories. As the motto goes, "We were, we are, and we will: forever." The phrase "we will" is a promise of action shared between Sons and their allies in solidarity and doubles as a threat to their enemies.%0a%0aThe Sons of Piru deal in more varied areas than the Vices. Drugs are still a high point, but they deal primarily in crack, meth, PCP, and a surprising amount of ecstacy despite the other three so they can tap into the night lifers. They also have better connections than most: not only can they get their hands on some interesting things, but they know the right names and still have the right favors.%0a%0aParticularly dark reds mark them, preferably with a black background or highlights. Some wear custom printed t-shirts with a large crimson sun somewhere along them. Their weapons of choice are the traditional blades, razors, and shivs of the main Bloods, though they reserve them for people who need a reminder of who they really are.%0a%0a'''Leader:''' Michael Stone ''(CK Stone)''%0a%0a[--%25color=#365776%25[[#top| Back to top]]--] %0a-----%0a%0a[[#SPEnd]]%0a[[#BLEnd]]%0a%0a[[#CR]]%0a!Crips%0a**[[#BMC|Blue Magic Crips]]%0a**[[#TMGE|Tri-Megas]]%0a**[[#OG|Old Ghosts]]%0a%0a[[#BMC]]%0a'''Blue Magic Crips'''%0a%0a'''Nicknames:''' ''Blues, Magics, Stars.''%0a%0aThough the underworld is inherently dark and terrible, the Blue Magics have the most popular image. They've been around and stable for a lot longer than most sets, with major players at least as old as the Sons of Piru, whom they consider their rivals. With their music, their money, and playing off a lighter side of their dealings, they strut the line between a happy public face and a much darker one behind closed doors.%0a%0aThe Magics run the majority of the prostitution, and even take cuts in exchange for the promise of backup for people that aren't even in their territory. They also deal most heavily in party drugs and uppers like cocain, ecstacy, and all the rest. The popular image they like to show is the classic "pimps and hoes" look, but the reality of the situation is much darker, violent, and subjugating. The purchase of flesh and human trafficking is never happy business, even if everyone's smiling.%0a%0aTheir territory isn't highly contested, if only because they don't really have to enforce much of it. The other gangs know they're a strong set and the Magics don't push much for official territory: they have enough tendrils to span what they need to.%0a%0aThe Blue Magic Crips favor the strong blue shades typical of the main Crips. If there's a motif or jewelry, stars or burst shapes of any number of points are common, but six points are preferred. Their choice of weapons varies, as they tend to have the money to get what they need. There's a certain prestige to owning some kind of customized weapon that at least started as blunt, like a painted cane with a nice gem, or a bat with six nails sticking out.%0a%0a'''Leader:''' Gordon Prince ''(The Prince)''%0a%0a[--%25color=#365776%25[[#top| Back to top]]--] %0a-----%0a%0a[[#BMCEnd]]%0a%0a[[#TMGE]]%0a'''Tri-Megas'''%0a%0aThe Tri-Megas are currently associated with the Blue Magic Crips, with enough power to be considered a minor but decent player among the Crips in general.%0a%0aSee the Cult writeup for the Tri-Megas for more information!%0a%0a%0a[--%25color=#365776%25[[#top| Back to top]]--] %0a-----%0a[[#TMGEEnd]]%0a%0a[[#OG]]%0a'''Old Ghosts'''%0a%0a'''Nicknames:''' ''OG's, Ghosts.''%0a%0aThe Old Ghosts are the only Asian Boyz set in the area, and though they're under the Crip banner they work mostly on a business level with the Magics. They've had to restructure several times due to attacks by the Bloods, and as a result have recently begun taking on members of more varied stripes than they're used to. Having learned from the gang fights that broke them down, their tactics have also changed to reflect it.%0a%0aThey run drugs as many do, particularly exotic ones like opium. They're also decent smugglers of any and all things. The drugs keep them fairly rich, but the smuggling gets a lot of their money, too. Buyers will pay a lot for something old and foreign with the right story, but many are just as willing to buy in living things: exotic pets and exotic women are just as much for sale. Their smuggling and human trafficking works well with the Blue Magic Crips, whom are willing to pay quite a bit for equipment, interesting things, and women to keep their prostitution rings alive.%0a%0aOG territory is fairly varied but not always obviously marked: it's a fun strategy for them to tag odd places, then quote it as the reason for violent response. With the mysterious deaths that come from messing with the Ghosts in recent years, most gangs advise avoiding asian neighbourhoods in general or wearing something bulletproof.%0a%0aThe Ghosts prefer dark gray or black to mark them, but allow for white highlights. Death imagery is common, all the better if it mixes with the common Asian Boyz imagery of dragons or crystals. Long knives, machetes, and short swords of various styles are their weapons of choice, but they also have occasional access to something automatic if they're trusted enough to keep it hidden.%0a%0a'''Leader:''' Mach Thi Loan  ''(OG Mack, Ghost Lady)''%0a%0a[--%25color=#365776%25[[#top| Back to top]]--] %0a-----%0a%0a[[#OGEnd]]%0a[[#CREnd]]%0a%0a[[#IN]]%0a!Independents%0a**[[#SSS|South Side Soldiers]]%0a**[[#MS|Midnight Shakers]]%0a**[[#BRC|Blackroot Coalition]]%0a%0a[[#SSS]]%0a'''South Side Soldiers'''%0a%0a'''Nicknames:''' ''Trips (from "Triple-S"), 319's, Soldiers.''%0a%0aThe Trips are a new gang, formed off the disenfranchised members of the Bloods and Crips during the fights that have formed the city's territory. They've locked off a section of the south despite their fewer numbers, but part of the reason they're still alive is because they aren't a main focus of the Bloods or the Crips. If they're ever going to take more territory or get richer, they need more guns to do it with.%0a%0aAs for what keeps them afloat, the Trips deal in whatever illicit business they can, though it tends to stay fairly low-level just from the lack of connections. They continue to operate in southern neighbourhoods, promising businesses and sometimes entire streets to keep the Bloods & Crips out for the right sums of money. They keep that promise, but nowadays they're not much better than either group, and the money is now more along the lines of a protection scam that nobody's bold enough to point out.%0a%0aTrip territory is always clearly marked with their wispy triple-S either vertically or horizontally. Whatever their alignment, they tend to be followed by disrespectful signs and markings toward the Bloods and Crips or other poor sentiments.%0a%0aTheir color tends to be orange, of whatever shades they can get. Images of guns and other soldier-ish weapons are common iconography, especially as tattoos - typically with a "319" on it where the serial number would be. They tend to enjoy similar weapons, picking up ka-bars and copies of gun models used in wars.%0a%0a'''Leader:''' Omar Santiago%0a%0a[--%25color=#365776%25[[#top| Back to top]]--] %0a-----%0a%0a[[#SSSEnd]]%0a%0a[[#MS]]%0a'''Midnight Shakers'''%0a%0a'''Nicknames:''' ''Shakers, MS, various insulting words.''%0a%0aThe Midnight Shakers are particularly new, maybe six months in the game and without much known about them or any formal leader; this is mostly because they don't really announce themselves or have any formal colors. In fact, most of what they've done tends to get attributed to other gangs for a while due to their practice of wearing confusing gang colors for their operations. Like chameleons, they switch to whatever colors and imagery suit their needs for the night. Wearing the same or opposite colors as other gangs is great for selling drugs, distractions, muggings, and raids. They've even run a raid or two on the other gangs with their confusing attire. %0a%0aThe truth of the matter, or at least what's said by the Shakers that have been asked what the hell they're doing before they "go missing," is that they're just looking to get what they need and keep the heat off them. They attribute the worst of their acts to a few of their more anarchistic members that are just starting things under the pretenses of distracting the other gangs or trying to point them at each other. Of course, that doesn't save them when they're caught.%0a%0aThe Shakers themselves aren't run by any strong centralizing force. They have a leader, but they're not really the one running all ths shows. In fact, there are smaller groups within the set that go about their business under the same general laws and share the name.%0a%0aIf the Shakers ever tag, it's with a capital "M" in straight vertical and horizontal lines (like a sideways E), with an S through the middle bar like a dollar sign.%0a%0a'''Leader:''' ''Unknown''%0a%0a[--%25color=#365776%25[[#top| Back to top]]--] %0a-----%0a%0a[[#MSEnd]]%0a%0a[[#BRC]]%0a'''Blackroot Coalition'''%0a%0a%25Red%25(See the Cult writeup for the Coille for more information on the Blackroots!)%25%25%0a%0aThe Blackroot Coalition seems to have popped up out of nowhere, with no particular area or group of people to call their own. Nobody on the streets are quite sure what their overall goals are, but they know they have a firm hold on a few parks and only deal with drugs found in nature. Ambrosia's the only real edge that have in the drug business; it's rare for them to sell the gold-red resin often, but its hallucinogenic effects are unique enough to have a few hippie buyers.%0a%0aThe Blackroots aren't a very active gang in comparison to the others. In fact, they're almost off the map entirely, only taking up border territories and not enforcing them as harshly as other gangs might. There's no interconnection or history to speak of with them and the other gangs beyond some minor fist-fights.%0a%0aTheir colors tend to be green with black highlights, especially in patterns with interconnected or wavy lines, though pure black is also acceptable.

On the darkened streets of Savannah, enforcing the law isn't as clear as the system would ever want. Those who answer the call for order are burdened: not just by the weight of their work, but the choices they must make.%0a%0a'''Summary:'''%0a%0aThe police of the city are integrated, but still spread too far over the city. Response times are slow in all but the richest parts of town or for the right names, and the low crime rates on paper aren't quite what they seem. The force does what it can, but it's never enough to help all the people who need them. Between the officers who see the law in black and white, let things slide, misuse their power, or are on the take, the streets have never been quite so safe or so dangerous as when the police roll into the chaos.%0a%0a'''Precincts & Jurisdiction:'''%0a%0aThe police area is fairly small to begin, but it'll expand with interest as more NPCs are needed! The real city and county police forces are integrated, but to streamline police activity and participation, the precincts and subgroups (SWAT, K9) are considered to be more integrated than they normally would be. These groups tend to fall under the same umbrellas, so consider them connected; the actual IRL complexities of a lot of these areas are too numerous and Byzantine for a socially-interactive online RPG to deal with, so we're just running them by "divisions" and not sweating the little stuff.%0a%0aPlayers are free to join all police storylines related to their field; for example, all homicide-related officers can join in on homicide investigations, and even characters in other fields can work around them a bit. This full integration may not always be the case in the future, especially if there's a huge rush of law enforcement PCs in the future, but in the meantime it'll get everyone together.%0a%0a'''Equality:'''%0a%0aThough, Savannah is located within the deep South of the United States, the police department has made great strides in equality. In 2011, Brandi Cross was the first female officer to be selected for the Warner Robins police S.W.A.T team. Additionally the Fire Department, in the same year, graduated nine black male recruits and one black female recruit, a full one-third of the class, in comparison to the previous year where only one black male had been recruited. By examining these statistics, a player can see that Savannah’s public service departments are working towards a progressive future.%0a%0a[--%25color=#365776%25[[#top| Back to top]]--] %0a-----%0a[[#PIntEnd]]%0a%0a%0a[[#PBra]]%0a!!Police Branches & NPCs%0a***[[#PBAdm|Administrative Branch]]%0a***[[#PBLeg|Legal Branch]]%0a***[[#PBInv|Investigative Branch]]%0a***[[#PBPat|Patrol Branch]]%0a[[#PBraEnd]]%0a%0a[[#PBAdm]]%0a!!Administrative Branch%0a'''Chief of Police - Chief Rufus Blake:''' Venerable Bullshit-Generator\\%0a'''Chief's Assistant - Maj.

Forbidden Lore is for ''pure'' Mortals only. Wolfbloods, Ghouls, Sleepwalkers, and other sub-splats (as well as Ensorcelled) cannot utilize it, nor will they retain it if they become a member of a full splat (a potentially deadly change in the first place.) Furthermore, characters with Forbidden Lore cannot be made into those sub-splats or similar crossover elements, such as Ghouls, Ensorcelled etc. The Blood Bond and Lunacy will still apply to FL PCs, but keep in mind that they have additional powers and insanity that may cause them to explode the Supernatural character, and typically a cult that may facilitate further exploding of one or both parties.%0a%0a%0a->'''Powers:''' Powers will be rated by their appropriate level inside the parent splat (e.g. a level 2 Gift, Discipline or Merit is a level 2 FL power) and only available from existing/sanctioned splats currently run on the site like Mage, Werewolf, Vampire, and Changeling. For balance reasons, not all potential powers powers will be available. Particularly, distinct powers granted from Bloodlines, Lodges, Legacies, etc. will not be available.%0a%0a->Characters will have access to level 1-3 powers. Powers at the 4-5 range will be rare, require more effort to gain, and may have additional pre-requisites. Details of all abilities (especially fluff components) may change subject to ST approval, flavor source, and power-tweaking.%0a%0a->Acquiring any powers from Forbidden Lore will be a potentially dangerous and involved process requiring ST'd scenes. Relative danger levels will be conveyed in advance for relevant scenes to allow players to back out if they'd rather do more work in advance or bide their time.%0a%0a->'''Insanity:''' You may only spend one Insanity per turn to fuel powers, though you have have more than one inflicted upon you in a turn by other sources (including the Optional Insanity Cost below.)%0a%0a->'''Pools:''' As per Mirrors, all powers available will use the die-pools already in place. If a power ''necessitates'' the use of a Power Stat, it is replaced by 3. For the purpose of all other powers at this time, FL characters have no Arcana or Renown, so their pools are simply Attribute + Ability.%0a%0a->'''Fluff:''' Forbidden Lore doesn't necessarily come from the splats the power comes from. As long as the functional aspects of the power remain the same, all else can change. For example, a gout of ethereal fire as per a direct-attack spell from Mage need not have the fluff of that Arcana, and could instead manifest as a bolt of chilling, enervating darkness as granted by some equally dark force so long as the mechanics are exactly the same.%0a%0a->'''Resistance:''' Characters with Forbidden Lore are still human and Mortal, but gain any natural resistance against powers afforded to beings that are not plain Mortals. For example, FL characters may roll Resolve + Composure to resist Vainglory 3 long enough to make an attack, as they are not distinctly "ordinary."%0a%0a[--%25color=#365776%25[[#top| Back to top]]--]%0a[[#R]]%0a!!Relics%0a%0a->These run as per the normal rules from ''Reliquary'', with the following changes for online use.

If you are a Mortal player and seek to have a Relic, talk to a Mortal ST about it! We're always willing to work something out, though what is gained may come at a chilling cost...%0a%0a->'''Availability:''' Just like Forbidden Lore, not all items will be available for PC use, as per balance and general ST stuffs.%0a%0a->'''Optional Insanity Cost:''' Whenever a Relic or Cursed Item would require Willpower points to activate, characters may choose to replace any amount of that Willpower cost with 3 points of Insanity.

Located [[http://wantonwicked.gamingsandbox.com/wiki/index.php?n=GameRef.GameInterfaceHelp| herein]] is a plethora of information about this new function, and it’s heavily suggested for a player to read this before proceeding on with this post. %0a%0aAs Mortal ST’s, we fully endorse the exploration of the creative component of your character development and story. Bluebooking is great, and the mortal ST team wants you to have fun with it! Even if we can’t see what you’re posting, you can, and it’s a good opportunity to flesh out your character and explore their minds! Once per month, bonus experience may be rewarded to players who send us an example of their amazing blue booking. The reason for this incentive is due to the honest fact that we gain inspiration from what drives your characters. In storylines, we fully expect to add personal touches of horror and excitement, and in order to do this, we really need to know what’s going on in their minds and lives. %0a%0aAll submissions for this bonus experience opportunity must have the request field of “Month, Bonus Experience Bluebooking” with the selected blue booking attached to the request. The submission time for these entries is the ''16th until the 23rd''.

They vye to reach the true heights of power that each individual can attain in their field ("realm") of choice, guided by intense heraldric totemism that glorifies their desired traits and focuses them into an image and legacy. To each Sovereign, every interaction is a struggle for dominance, and everything is a bargaining tool. All that ever matters is power: how much you have, how much you can get, and how much you can use. The internal structures of the Sovereigns constantly shift as a result of all the power-brokering and backstabbing that comes from these struggles, but they are nonetheless forces to be reckoned with. The only ties that bind them are a short list of rules called the Empyreal Accord, and the sheer power they all share.%0a%0aJoining the Sovereigns involves being sponsored and taught by another Sovereign to respect power first and foremost. After a degree of zealotry is proven, the initiate chooses a totem, makes a crest, then performs a short ritual (ask for details) and presentation of their crest to the other Sovereigns.%0a%0a'''Totem & Crest:''' Each Sovereign designs their own personal crest based on a totem animal of their choice, whether it's a living creature, an extinct one, or a mythological being. They characterize their totem however they wish, so long as it exemplifies the sort of power they seek; a wolf or bull might be chosen by a ruthless corporate CEO, while a bat or mouse might be chosen by backroom dealer in secrets.%0a%0a!!Empyreal Sovereign NPCs:%0a%0a[[Players.AlbertWainwright|Albert Wainwright]]: The Golden Eagle (Cult Leader)%0a%0a'''Jasmine Miller:''' The Whispering Bat (Intelligence Specialist)%0a%0a'''Kevin Barnes:''' The Mad Wolf (Blood Vice Gang Leader)%0a%0a%0a!!How to become involved:%0a%0aMake one!

Funerals have shifted from small religious gatherings to an anesthetized gathering of individuals to honor the idea of life, rather than death. With these progressive changes, Sterling Industries has changed too. Gone is the image of a mom and pop business, and in,is the Sterling Industries sterile brand, pioneered by the reigning patriarch Frances- Archibald Sterling. %0a%0aThough, the Sterling families largest acquisition is the fleet of funeral homes that litter the South, they also maintain a hefty stock market portfolio which holds large slices of recognizable companies in a variety of business sectors, ensuring that their fingers are in almost all of the monetary pies in Georgia.%0a%0a'''About The Sterling Family :''' '-(OOC)-'%0a%0a'''[[Players.Frances-ArchibaldSterling|Frances-Archibald Sterling]]:''' The Reigning Patriarch%0a%0a'''[[Players.SeleneSterling|Selene Sterling-Montgomery]]:''' The Reigning Matriarch%0a%0a'''Eliza Sterling:''' In Memorium%0a%0a'''[[Players.SebastianSterling|Sebastian Sterling]]:''' The Prodigal Son%0a%0a'''[[Players.PatiaSterling|Patia Sterling]]:''' In Pieces.%0a%0aFrances-Archibald is the domineering patriarch of the Sterling lineage. He was born for the role of the patriarch, and summarily groomed throughout his entire life to ensure the success of his industry as well as his family. He's a man who maintains a physical and emotional distance from those he interact with, though, rumor says that he fell apart at the death of his eldest daughter, Eliza, some years ago. He's not a man eager to please, though, he does appreciate those that seek to curry his favor. %0a%0aIn contrast to Archibald, his wife, Selene is more socially aware and forgiving. She's accustomed to the small chit-chat of business, as well as the small social exchanges that pass by without word. She's active in high society but has become less gaudy in her later years than she was previously. Recently, despite their active past of being impeccable hosts, the Sterling's have stepped away from hosting events at their lush estate and grounds.%0a%0aSebastian Sterling, the heir apparent, is a man in his 30's whose returned to Georgia after nearly a decade away, presumably to assume his place as the leader of Sterling Industries. He's a man raised on country clubs and events, but seems entirely bored with it now. Rumors state that he was nearly a doctor before he returned back to the estate, an interesting pursuit given what the families main investments are. Frequently he's seen around town, rather than within the confines of the large family estate. %0a%0aFinally, there is Patia Sterling, the youngest daughter of the Sterling line. Strangely, though her mother is active in socialite and high society events, Patia isn't. Instead, she is known as something of a recluse, oftentimes only being spotted at events that take place within her families estate and grounds. She's a pretty girl in her 20's, but in the brief encounters that acquaintances have with her, they always state that something seems 'off' about the girl. Rumors at times are known to follow Patia, and the particularly vicious ones state that she's known to bounce in and out of mental health facilities and rehabilitation houses. %0a%0a'''How To Become Involved:'''%0a%0aIf your character is involved in the ''finances'' or ''High Society'' world, they may know a Sterling or two.

Originally share-croppers, lured over towards the humid climate from England with the promises of fertile land and a break from the classicist world of London, The Spivey’s have no stories of glory, like their counterparts, but they do have a history. %0a%0aHalf of the Spivey’s went for the Civil War, vetting on the Confederates and losing their lives. The other half stayed in Savannah and almost fled out of the state when they heard about Atlanta burning. The only reason they dared to stay was in desire of watching the destruction of the slave holding rich. And sure, the rich did suffer for an awful few years, but when the reconstruction was “finished” and the county elect was brought into place, all of those old families with their slave owning names fell into their places of affluency once again, but this time in positions of government and authority. Meanwhile, the Spivey’s had a handful of confederate bill-folds, worth nothing, and not even an acre of land to cultivate. %0a%0aThey moved into Savannah, without much else of anywhere to settle and have spent almost 200 years, fighting for their damned survival. %0a%0aDue to a lack of money, terrible luck and their overall spite for the world, the Spivey’s have always found themselves in the worst kind of underworld businesses. From small time gambling dens, to prostitution and all the way to meth production, the Spivey’s are a legacy their own in entire Savannah. %0a%0aAt current, they control a small portion of meth production and pill farma, but inevitably, they’ll have to move onto something else whenever the long arm of the law finds them. Most of the male Spivey’s have been to prison, and many of the women have been in jail so often that the cops know them by name. But god, do they try to aim for success.%0a%0a!!Spivey Clan NPCs:%0a%0a'''Jericho Spivey Senior:''' The Good For Nothing%0a%0a'''Kayda Spivey:''' His Old Lady%0a%0a'''Jericho Spivey Junior:''' Just Like His Father%0a%0a'''Josephina Spivey:''' Hopeless%0a%0a'''Areas of Influence:''' Underworld, Drug Culture%0a%0a[--%25color=#365776%25[[#top| Back to top]]--]%0a-----%0a[[#SPVF]]%0a!!!Faction Initiations Merit (Lineage: Spivey)%0a''(Choose one bonus from each tier.)''%0a%0a%25red%25&#9679;%25%25 Science (Chemistry), Contacts (Underworld) (&#9679;), or Direction Sense (&#9679;).\\%0a%25red%25&#9679;&#9679;%25%25 Danger Sense (&#9679;&#9679;) or Fast Reflexes (&#9679;&#9679;).\\%0a%25red%25&#9679;&#9679;&#9679;%25%25 Cost break on Larceny & Stealth (x2) or Spelunker (&#9679;&#9679; or +&#9679;).\\%0a%25red%25&#9679;&#9679;&#9679;&#9679;%25%25 Fighting Style (Improvised Weaponry) (&#9679;&#9679;&#9679; or +&#9679;&#9679;), Scientist's Sense (&#9679;&#9679;&#9679;), Trip Sitter (&#9679;&#9679;&#9679;), or Spelunker (&#9679;&#9679;&#9679; or +&#9679;&#9679;).\\%0a%25red%25&#9679;&#9679;&#9679;&#9679;&#9679;%25%25 Friend (Spivey Clan) (&#9679;&#9679;&#9679;) or a unique storyline containing a cursed item.\\%0a%0a[[#SPVEnd]]%0a[[#SPVFEnd]]%0a[--%25color=#365776%25[[#top| Back to top]]--]%0a%0a-----%0a%0a[[#TL]]%0a!Taylor Lineage%0a**[[#TLM|Taylor Lineage Faction Initiations Bonus]]%0a%0a'''Marquee Savannah:'''%0a%0aThe Taylor family is an African American family that has been in Savannah for nearly four generations, but it wasn’t until the past 20 that they’ve been able to make a name for themselves. William Taylor, a commanding and frugal businessman, was able to turn his run down inheritance of broken buildings into a modernization of Savannah’s nightclub and entertainment scene. %0a%0aOriginally a small family owned construction business, known for their excellent restorations and handiwork, the Taylor family has founded Marquee Savannah within the local entertainment sector. From cigar bars to Blues Joints, The Taylor’s own 4 of Savannah’s hottest clubs, an art gallery, and the Fall of 2013 announces the opening of their new restaurant “Marquee”. %0a%0aPhilanthropists, the Taylor family works with the Savannah Community towards a vision of a sleek and modern tomorrow which melds the historical architecture of the city. Natasha Taylor, works primarily with volunteer organizations to help coordinate events at the Taylor venues. Meanwhile, William Taylor runs weekend long seminars to help the poor and lower middle class learn about smart investing and how to start a small business. %0a%0a%0a'''About The Taylor Family:''' '-(OOC)-'%0a%0a'''[[Players.WilliamTaylor|William Taylor]]:''' The Baron%0a%0a'''[[Players.Natasha Taylor|Natasha Taylor]]:''' The Second Wife%0a%0a'''[[Players.TrishaTaylor|Trisha Taylor]]:''' The Snoop%0a%0a'''[[Players.DwayneTaylor|Dwayne Taylor]]:''' Bon Vivant%0a%0aThe Taylor family is associated with so much of Savannah’s culture, that it’s particularly easier to say what they aren’t involved with. %0a%0aWilliam Taylor is a prominent and middle aged man who tries to use the gossip columns pre-occupation with his family to his advantage. He’s charismatic, boisterous and friendly, and given all the money he donates into local philanthropist organizations, he’s often seen in a saintly light. There’s rumors that his business practices are a whole lot less winsome, but often, these rumors are fought by the kinder stories of his community involvement, including the seminars he often runs. Personable, he’ll offer anyone a seat at his table, and is ingratiated into the culture of Savannah, oftentimes dining locally or having a drink at a local bar.%0a%0aNatasha Taylor is William Taylor’s second wife, though his first, Connie, is rarely ever seen. Natasha, 30, is a failed model, a failed fashion designer and a failed interior designer, but she’s excelling at being social eye candy. She takes full advantage of the Taylor nightclubs and is known for her parties in equal measure to her fundraisers, Natasha, is a woman who’s almost always having an event. Rumor has it that Natasha’s trying to break into the upper echelons of Savannah society.%0a%0aTrisha Taylor is William’s oldest child and is a recent graduate of Savannah State University, in Journalism. She stays detached from her families affairs, though the media is prone to mentioning her in their society columns. She currently works for Savannah Morning News, and can be spotted around town sleuthing for stories. %0a%0aDwayne Taylor is the youngest and is barely 20, though that doesn't stop him from drinking in his father’s clubs. He’s known for his antics, which often are plastered across the gossip columns. He’s known for his excess and womanizing and at times can be seen attempting to fit in with harder, street affiliated friends.%0a %0a'''How to become involved:'''%0a%0aIf your character is involved in the nightlife, arts or high society world, they may know the Taylor’s.

Originally share-croppers, lured over towards the humid climate from England with the promises of fertile land and a break from the classicist world of London, The Spivey’s have no stories of glory, like their counterparts, but they do have a history.%0a%3c Half of the Spivey’s went for the Civil War, vetting on the Confederates and losing their lives. The other half stayed in Savannah and almost fled out of the state when they heard about Atlanta burning. The only reason they dared to stay was in desire of watching the destruction of the slave holding rich. And sure, the rich did suffer for an awful few years, but when the reconstruction was “finished” and the county elect was brought into place, all of those old families with their slave owning names fell into their places of affluency once again, but this time in positions of government and authority. Meanwhile, the Spivey’s had a handful of confederate bill-folds, worth nothing, and not even an acre of land to cultivate.%0a%3c They moved into Savannah, without much else of anywhere to settle and have spent almost 200 years, fighting for their damned survival.%0a%3c Due to a lack of money, terrible luck and their overall spite for the world, the Spivey’s have always found themselves in the worst kind of underworld businesses. From small time gambling dens, to prostitution and all the way to meth production, the Spivey’s are a legacy their own in entire Savannah.%0a%3c At current, they control a small portion of meth production and pill farma, but inevitably, they’ll have to move onto something else whenever the long arm of the law finds them. Most of the male Spivey’s have been to prison, and many of the women have been in jail so often that the cops know them by name. But god, do they try to aim for success.%0a%3c %0a%3c !!!Members of the Family%0a%3c Jericho Spivey Senior: The Good For Nothing%0a%3c Kayda Spivey: His Old Lady%0a%3c Jericho Spivey Junior: Just Like His Father%0a%3c Josephina Spivey: Hopeless%0a%3c Areas of Influence: Underworld, Drug Culture%0a%3c [[#L-SpEnd]]%0a%3c [[#L-SpOOC]]%0a%3c !!OOC Information: Spivey Family%0a%3c !!!How to Become Involved:%0a%3c %0a%3c !!!Areas of Influence:%0a%3c %0a%3c >>lrindent frame bgcolor=#eeeeee padding=25px%3c%3c%0a%3c Spivey Lineage Faction Initiations Bonus'''%0a%3c (Choose one bonus from each tier.)%0a%3c :Tier &#9679;:%0a%3c *Science Specialty (Chemistry)%0a%3c *Contacts (Underworld) &#9679;%0a%3c *Direction Sense &#9679;%0a%3c :Tier &#9679;&#9679;:%0a%3c *Danger Sense &#9679;&#9679;%0a%3c *Fast Reflexes &#9679;&#9679;%0a%3c :Tier &#9679;&#9679;&#9679;:%0a%3c *Cost break on Larceny and Stealth (x2)%0a%3c *Spelunker &#9679;&#9679; or +&#9679;%0a%3c :Tier &#9679;&#9679;&#9679;&#9679;: %0a%3c *Fighting Style (Improvised Weaponry) &#9679;&#9679;&#9679; or +&#9679;&#9679;%0a%3c *Scientist's Sense &#9679;&#9679;&#9679;%0a%3c *Trip Sitter &#9679;&#9679;&#9679;%0a%3c *Spelunker &#9679;&#9679;&#9679; or +&#9679;&#9679;%0a%3c :Tier &#9679;&#9679;&#9679;&#9679;&#9679;:%0a%3c *Friend (Spivey Clan) &#9679;&#9679;&#9679;%0a%3c *Unique storyline containing a cursed item%0a%3c >>%3c%3c%0a%3c [[#L-SpOOCEnd]]%0a%3c %0a%3c [[#L-St]]%0a%3c !!Sterling Family Lineage%0a%3c http://i.imgur.com/puXhvwv.png%0a%3c %0a%3c The Sterling family is an institution in Georgia.

Soon after, the cities first African American mayor, Floyd Adams Jr (D) was elected in 1996, and at current the city has had 17 year long streak of Democrat African American mayors, including the current mayor Edna Jackson, who is also the first female African American mayor. %0a> %0a> Savannah has utilized the council/manager form of government since 1954.

The other two members and the mayor are elected at-large. %0a> %0a> The role of the city council is to enact levies and ordinances as well as adopt the annual budget and appoint the City Manager.

Every lens is focusing, and every revealed story leaks more of the unfathomable truth. %0a> %0a> For nearly 200 years, Savannah has relied on print media as its primary source. The printing press, in the hands of the affluent few, was the sole producer of the cities only newspapers. As a consequence, a monopoly of news agencies took hold of the city. Information was controlled by an exclusive hierarchy of journalists and their editors, and in turn, a mirage of truth was cultivated on the front pages of these newspapers. %0a> %0a> The 21st century has given way to a new technology, the internet, which contests the antiqued hold that these companies maintain within Savannah. Already, the venerable Savannah Evening News has fallen, and its sister newspaper, The Savannah Morning News, finds its subscription base falling. In an attempt of siphoning the hemorrhaging, the newspaper has attempted to modernize itself, to present a sleeker and younger appearance. %0a> %0a> In conjunction to the threat that is the internet, technology continues to march forward. With the advancement of cell phones and digital cameras, it’s difficult to control the torrent of information before it reaches the blogs and indie media found on the internet.  The thick and dusty curtain within Savannah is peeling back with every amateur photographer, with every truth seeker, and soon the hidden belly of the city will be revealed. All it takes is the right shot, the right story, and the right place at the right time. %0a> %0a> '''Current News Agencies:'''%0a> %0a> *Savannah Morning News %0a> %0a> *DoSavannah %0a> %0a923,1024c813,824%0a%3c [[#LocationsEnd]]%0a%3c %0a%3c %0a%3c %0a%3c !

Reminders of it cultivate a dogmatic society of tradition, splintered by the families who try to bury the shame of their past, and the families who exalt within it. %0a> In ages past, Savannah was a city of Southern romantic tradition, with all of the trappings that came with it. Southern Belles were debuted in lavish displays of affluence; the landed gentry cultivated a theatrical ideal of honor, even going so far as to adopt the Code Duello to enact their vengeance. Monied family names became legacies of tradition and legend, while their prejudices continued to divide a city and world.%0a> %0a> Though the preserved streets of Savannah are left unchanged, the cultural landscape of the city is transforming. Legacies fueled by their old money are finding their gilded cages cracking as a new generation of affluence rises into the upper echelons of their world. Beneath the veneer of polite society hides the menacing world of haughty gossip and deadly rivalries. The upcoming conflicts of Savannah’s society will dictate whether tradition is proven to be long lasting, if it can evolve for a changing world or if it will be torn asunder by the future.%0a> %0a> Members of High Society will not only need to navigate the treacherous dangers of their entangled world, but also have to face the challenges beseeched upon them by an increasingly obsessed world of hungry paparazzo’s and a voyeuristic world that is continuously waiting for their slip up.%0a> %0a1026,1292c826%0a%3c %0a%3c [[#C-ES]]%0a%3c !!The Empyreal Sovereigns%0a%3c The Sovereigns seek power - all of it. They vye to reach the true heights of power that each individual can attain in their field ("realm") of choice, guided by intense heraldric totemism that glorifies their desired traits and focuses them into an image and legacy. To each Sovereign, every interaction is a struggle for dominance, and everything is a bargaining tool. All that ever matters is power: how much you have, how much you can get, and how much you can use. The internal structures of the Sovereigns constantly shift as a result of all the power-brokering and backstabbing that comes from these struggles, but they are nonetheless forces to be reckoned with. The only ties that bind them are a short list of rules called the Empyreal Accord, and the sheer power they all share.%0a%3c %0a%3c Joining the Sovereigns involves being sponsored and taught by another Sovereign to respect power first and foremost. After a degree of zealotry is proven, the initiate chooses a totem, makes a crest, then performs a short ritual (ask for details) and presentation of their crest to the other Sovereigns.%0a%3c %0a%3c :Totem & Crest: Each Sovereign designs their own personal crest based on a totem animal of their choice, whether it's a living creature, an extinct one, or a mythological being. They characterize their totem however they wish, so long as it exemplifies the sort of power they seek; a wolf or bull might be chosen by a ruthless corporate CEO, while a bat or mouse might be chosen by backroom dealer in secrets.%0a%3c %0a%3c !!!OOC Information%0a%3c !!!!Empyreal Sovereign NPCs:%0a%3c *[[Albert Wainwright]]: The Golden Eagle (Cult Leader)%0a%3c *[[Jasmine Miller]]: The Whispering Bat (Intelligence Specialist)%0a%3c *[[Kevin Barnes]]: The Mad Wolf (Blood Vice Gang Leader)%0a%3c %0a%3c !!!!How to become involved:%0a%3c Make one!

Or at least movies, namely, The Garden of Good and Evil. Its history is saturated with the sins of slavery, a nation divided in war and a culture of adversity. In its modern history, Savannah Georgia elected its first female mayor, Susan Weiner (R), in 1992, which helped herald a change to the cities political landscape. Soon after, the cities first African American mayor, Floyd Adams Jr (D) was elected in 1996, and at current the city has had 17 year long streak of Democrat African American mayors, including the current mayor Edna Jackson, who is also the first female African American mayor. %0a%3c %0a%3c Savannah has utilized the council/manager form of government since 1954. The council/manager form of city government is constructed of a city council which includes the mayor and eight alderman, six of which are elected from one of the six aldermanic districts. The other two members and the mayor are elected at-large. %0a%3c %0a%3c The role of the city council is to enact levies and ordinances as well as adopt the annual budget and appoint the City Manager. Meanwhile, the City Manager enacts the policies and programs established by council, as well as recommends an annual budget and work programs. Additionally, the City Manager appoints bureau and department heads and exercises general supervision and control over the city employees.%0a%3c %0a%3c '''Mayor:''' Elizabeth Jackson%0a%3c %0a%3c '''City Manager:''' Christina Hutcheson %0a%3c %0a%3c '''Post 1 At-Large''': Cecelia Dell%0a%3c %0a%3c '''Post 2 At-Large''': Lawrence Mayville%0a%3c %0a%3c '''District 1''': Jordan Creighton%0a%3c %0a%3c '''District 2''': Ann Shirley%0a%3c %0a%3c '''District 3''': Kevin Burk%0a%3c %0a%3c '''District 4''': Mina Sanders%0a%3c %0a%3c '''District 5''': Dr. Rita Marshall%0a%3c %0a%3c '''District 6''': Wendy Nowling%0a%3c  %0a%3c [--%25color=#365776%25[[#top| Back to top]]--]%0a%3c [[#POEnd]] %0a---%0a> [[#HSEnd]]%0a1294,1312c828,835%0a%3c [[#Media]]%0a%3c !!Media%0a%3c %25width=650px%25http://i.imgur.com/4jT9nPm.jpg%0a%3c '''Media Theme:'''  Technology marches to the beat of a war drum and threatens the traditions of print media. Every lens is focusing, and every revealed story leaks more of the unfathomable truth. %0a%3c %0a%3c For nearly 200 years, Savannah has relied on print media as its primary source. The printing press, in the hands of the affluent few, was the sole producer of the cities only newspapers. As a consequence, a monopoly of news agencies took hold of the city. Information was controlled by an exclusive hierarchy of journalists and their editors, and in turn, a mirage of truth was cultivated on the front pages of these newspapers. %0a%3c %0a%3c The 21st century has given way to a new technology, the internet, which contests the antiqued hold that these companies maintain within Savannah. Already, the venerable Savannah Evening News has fallen, and its sister newspaper, The Savannah Morning News, finds its subscription base falling. In an attempt of siphoning the hemorrhaging, the newspaper has attempted to modernize itself, to present a sleeker and younger appearance. %0a%3c %0a%3c In conjunction to the threat that is the internet, technology continues to march forward. With the advancement of cell phones and digital cameras, it’s difficult to control the torrent of information before it reaches the blogs and indie media found on the internet.  The thick and dusty curtain within Savannah is peeling back with every amateur photographer, with every truth seeker, and soon the hidden belly of the city will be revealed. All it takes is the right shot, the right story, and the right place at the right time. %0a%3c %0a%3c '''Current News Agencies:'''%0a%3c %0a%3c *Savannah Morning News %0a%3c %0a%3c *DoSavannah %0a%3c %0a%3c [--%25color=#365776%25[[#top| Back to top]]--]%0a%3c [[#MediaEnd]]%0a---%0a> [[#Medical]]%0a> !!Medical%0a> %25width=650px%25http://i.imgur.com/1unGCz1.png%0a> %0a> '''Theme:''' Within the stark white walls of Savannah’s hospitals, the legendary battle of Salvation and Finality continue to clash.

Reminders of it cultivate a dogmatic society of tradition, splintered by the families who try to bury the shame of their past, and the families who exalt within it. %0a%3c In ages past, Savannah was a city of Southern romantic tradition, with all of the trappings that came with it. Southern Belles were debuted in lavish displays of affluence; the landed gentry cultivated a theatrical ideal of honor, even going so far as to adopt the Code Duello to enact their vengeance. Monied family names became legacies of tradition and legend, while their prejudices continued to divide a city and world.%0a%3c %0a%3c Though the preserved streets of Savannah are left unchanged, the cultural landscape of the city is transforming. Legacies fueled by their old money are finding their gilded cages cracking as a new generation of affluence rises into the upper echelons of their world. Beneath the veneer of polite society hides the menacing world of haughty gossip and deadly rivalries. The upcoming conflicts of Savannah’s society will dictate whether tradition is proven to be long lasting, if it can evolve for a changing world or if it will be torn asunder by the future.%0a%3c %0a%3c Members of High Society will not only need to navigate the treacherous dangers of their entangled world, but also have to face the challenges beseeched upon them by an increasingly obsessed world of hungry paparazzo’s and a voyeuristic world that is continuously waiting for their slip up.%0a%3c %0a%3c [--%25color=#365776%25[[#top| Back to top]]--]%0a%3c [[#HSEnd]]%0a%3c -----%0a%3c [[#Medical]]%0a%3c !!Medical%0a%3c %25width=650px%25http://i.imgur.com/1unGCz1.png%0a%3c %0a%3c '''Theme:''' Within the stark white walls of Savannah’s hospitals, the legendary battle of Salvation and Finality continue to clash.

They vye to reach the true heights of power that each individual can attain in their field ("realm") of choice, guided by intense heraldric totemism that glorifies their desired traits and focuses them into an image and legacy. To each Sovereign, every interaction is a struggle for dominance, and everything is a bargaining tool. All that ever matters is power: how much you have, how much you can get, and how much you can use. The internal structures of the Sovereigns constantly shift as a result of all the power-brokering and backstabbing that comes from these struggles, but they are nonetheless forces to be reckoned with. The only ties that bind them are a short list of rules called the Empyreal Accord, and the sheer power they all share.%0a%3c %0a%3c Joining the Sovereigns involves being sponsored and taught by another Sovereign to respect power first and foremost. After a degree of zealotry is proven, the initiate chooses a totem, makes a crest, then performs a short ritual (ask for details) and presentation of their crest to the other Sovereigns.%0a%3c %0a%3c :Totem & Crest: Each Sovereign designs their own personal crest based on a totem animal of their choice, whether it's a living creature, an extinct one, or a mythological being. They characterize their totem however they wish, so long as it exemplifies the sort of power they seek; a wolf or bull might be chosen by a ruthless corporate CEO, while a bat or mouse might be chosen by backroom dealer in secrets.%0a%3c %0a%3c !!!OOC Information%0a%3c !!!!Empyreal Sovereign NPCs:%0a%3c *[[Albert Wainwright]]: The Golden Eagle (Cult Leader)%0a%3c *[[Jasmine Miller]]: The Whispering Bat (Intelligence Specialist)%0a%3c *[[Kevin Barnes]]: The Mad Wolf (Blood Vice Gang Leader)%0a%3c %0a%3c !!!!How to become involved:%0a%3c Make one!

Originally share-croppers, lured over towards the humid climate from England with the promises of fertile land and a break from the classicist world of London, The Spivey’s have no stories of glory, like their counterparts, but they do have a history. %0a%3c %0a%3c Half of the Spivey’s went for the Civil War, vetting on the Confederates and losing their lives. The other half stayed in Savannah and almost fled out of the state when they heard about Atlanta burning. The only reason they dared to stay was in desire of watching the destruction of the slave holding rich. And sure, the rich did suffer for an awful few years, but when the reconstruction was “finished” and the county elect was brought into place, all of those old families with their slave owning names fell into their places of affluency once again, but this time in positions of government and authority. Meanwhile, the Spivey’s had a handful of confederate bill-folds, worth nothing, and not even an acre of land to cultivate. %0a%3c %0a%3c They moved into Savannah, without much else of anywhere to settle and have spent almost 200 years, fighting for their damned survival. %0a%3c %0a%3c Due to a lack of money, terrible luck and their overall spite for the world, the Spivey’s have always found themselves in the worst kind of underworld businesses. From small time gambling dens, to prostitution and all the way to meth production, the Spivey’s are a legacy their own in entire Savannah. %0a%3c %0a%3c At current, they control a small portion of meth production and pill farma, but inevitably, they’ll have to move onto something else whenever the long arm of the law finds them. Most of the male Spivey’s have been to prison, and many of the women have been in jail so often that the cops know them by name. But god, do they try to aim for success.%0a%3c %0a%3c !!Spivey Clan NPCs:%0a%3c %0a%3c '''Jericho Spivey Senior:''' The Good For Nothing%0a%3c %0a%3c '''Kayda Spivey:''' His Old Lady%0a%3c %0a%3c '''Jericho Spivey Junior:''' Just Like His Father%0a%3c %0a%3c '''Josephina Spivey:''' Hopeless%0a%3c %0a%3c '''Areas of Influence:''' Underworld, Drug Culture%0a%3c %0a%3c [--%25color=#365776%25[[#top| Back to top]]--]%0a%3c -----%0a%3c [[#SPVF]]%0a%3c !Spivey Clan Lineage Faction Initiations Bonus%0a%3c %0a%3c &#9679; Science (Chemistry), Contacts (Underworld) (&#9679;), or Direction Sense (&#9679;)%0a%3c %0a%3c &#9679;&#9679; Danger Sense (&#9679;&#9679;) or Fast Reflexes (&#9679;&#9679;)%0a%3c %0a%3c &#9679;&#9679;&#9679; Cost break on Larceny and Stealth (x2), Spelunker (&#9679;&#9679; or +&#9679;)%0a%3c %0a%3c &#9679;&#9679;&#9679;&#9679; Fighting Style (Improvised Weaponry) (&#9679;&#9679;&#9679; or +&#9679;&#9679;), Scientist's Sense (&#9679;&#9679;&#9679;), Trip Sitter (&#9679;&#9679;&#9679;), Spelunker (&#9679;&#9679;&#9679; or +&#9679;&#9679;)%0a%3c %0a%3c &#9679;&#9679;&#9679;&#9679;&#9679; Friends (Spivey Clan) (&#9679;&#9679;&#9679;) or a unique story line containing a cursed item.%0a%3c [[#SPVEnd]]%0a%3c [[#SPVFEnd]]%0a%3c [--%25color=#365776%25[[#top| Back to top]]--]%0a%3c %0a%3c -----%0a

Response times are slow in all but the richest parts of town or for the right names, and the low crime rates on paper aren't quite what they seem. The force does what it can, but it's never enough to help all the people who need them. Between the officers who see the law in black and white, let things slide, misuse their power, or are on the take, the streets have never been quite so safe or so dangerous as when the police roll into the chaos.%0a%3c %0a%3c '''Note on Precincts & Jurisdiction:'''%0a%3c %0a%3c The police area is fairly small to begin, but it'll expand with interest as more NPCs are needed! The real city and county police forces are integrated, but to streamline police activity and participation, the precincts are considered to be more integrated than they normally would be. Players are free to join all police storylines related to their field; for example, all homicide-related officers can join in on homicide investigations, and even characters in other fields can work around them a bit. This full integration may not always be the case, especially if there's a huge rush of law enforcement PCs in the future, but in the meantime it'll get everyone together.%0a%3c %0a%3c %0a%3c [--%25color=#365776%25[[#top| Back to top]]--] %0a%3c -----%0a%3c [[#PIntEnd]]%0a%3c %0a%3c %0a%3c [[#PBra]]%0a%3c !!Police Branches & NPCs%0a%3c ***[[#PBAdm|Administrative Branch]]%0a%3c ***[[#PBLeg|Legal Branch]]%0a%3c ***[[#PBInv|Investigative Branch]]%0a%3c ***[[#PBPat|Patrol Branch]]%0a%3c [[#PBraEnd]]%0a%3c %0a%3c [[#PBAdm]]%0a%3c !!Administrative Branch%0a%3c '''Chief of Police - Chief Rufus Blake:''' Venerable Bullshit-Generator\\%0a%3c '''Chief's Assistant - Maj.

The struggle to survive and thrive is a delicate and dangerous balance, with the threat of destruction on all sides. Leave the glam at the door and pick up something heavier: the streets don't have time for the weak.%0a%3c %0a%3c '''Summary:'''%0a%3c %0a%3c The gangs of Savannah are almost evenly spread, but the violence never ends. Whether desperation or greed, the push for more, more, more leads to shady business and midnight sins. The Bloods and the Crips fight out their war with two large sets each, but hidden in the cracks and the unclaimed streets lie pockets of resistance and camaraderie that individually threaten the footholds and expansions of both as they seek their own niches.%0a%3c [--%25color=#365776%25[[#top| Back to top]]--] %0a%3c -----%0a%3c [[#GAEnd]]%0a%3c [[#BL]]%0a%3c !Bloods%0a%3c **[[#BV|Blood Vices]]%0a%3c **[[#SP|Sons of Piru]]%0a%3c %0a%3c [[#BV]]%0a%3c '''Blood Vices'''%0a%3c %0a%3c '''Nicknames:''' ''Vices, V's, Blood Hounds.''%0a%3c %0a%3c The Blood Vices are the strongest set of the Bloods, and hold the east with sheer power. They began small just 15 years ago from the fractured remains of other crews in the 80's, and under the leadership of the Mad Wolf they've made a huge comeback in the past 7-8 years. Becoming official Bloods is a newer development, as of 2010.%0a%3c %0a%3c What they have now was won with blood and sweat in outright war with the Mad Wolf on the front line. Their territory isn't the largest, but it's by far the most violently held, a fact that keeps them tightly knit and their enemies wary. Some long-standing survivors of other gangs, including some Bloods before the Vices shook hands with them, still bear the "wolf bite" scars of the Mad Wolf's signature weapon (and sometimes a grudge to match.) Though the violence in Blood Vice territory has gone down in recent years, the zeal of the Blood Vices hasn't ever faltered - they've just run out of people to fight.%0a%3c %0a%3c Their empire is built on drugs. Most of it's just weed and dashes of half-cut coke to yuppie kids that want to feel a rush of fear-laced adrenaline after a sale and say they're edgy, but they deal in purer cocaine and heroin beyond that. Some Vices may sell a greater variety through their list of contacts, though that's on a strictly individual level. For some cases and causes, as approved by the Mad Wolf, they also sell their services to protect people, places, and things, particularly in their territory but not limited to it.%0a%3c %0a%3c The Blood Vice colors are the traditional red of the Bloods, with a preference for white or gray as an off-color. Their tags vary, but stylized blood droplets, literal vices, or canine features typically mark their areas. The dog-paw trio of cigarette burned scars that some Bloods wear across the nation can be found somewhere on each and every Blood Vice, as a sign of solidarity and kinship to both the Bloods and the Mad Wolf himself. They favor weapons with points and hooks to leave gouging scars and torn corpses. Though relatively unused, pliers and bench-mounted vices are used to leave crushed, useless fingers or even limbs when the Blood Vices are particularly incensed. Despite these preferences, they still use straight blades for their initiation: drawing the blood of someone else (unwilling and unaware) through a full-force slash or stab.%0a%3c %0a%3c '''Leader:'''Kevin Barnes ''(The Mad Wolf)''%0a%3c [[#BVEnd]]%0a%3c %0a%3c [--%25color=#365776%25[[#top| Back to top]]--] %0a%3c -----%0a%3c %0a%3c [[#SP|Sons of Piru]]%0a%3c '''Sons of Piru'''%0a%3c %0a%3c '''Nicknames:''' ''Sons, Old Bloods.''%0a%3c %0a%3c If there was ever such a thing as noblity in the Bloods, the Sons would be close. Though they take whomever they can recruit, the old guard of the Sons of Piru are the children of gang members, and some even claim blood to the original Pirus that eventually became the Bloods. It's only true for one particular Son, but nobody cares. The gesture's really just a declaration of will and bond, and the only thing that really matters is tough blood and tough skin.%0a%3c %0a%3c On the gang scene, the Sons are survivors. Whatever's been thrown at them and their predecessors, they've lived through it all in some form or another. There's a long history that nobody cares to hear but everyone understands, even if they don't know the stories. As the motto goes, "We were, we are, and we will: forever." The phrase "we will" is a promise of action shared between Sons and their allies in solidarity and doubles as a threat to their enemies.%0a%3c %0a%3c The Sons of Piru deal in more varied areas than the Vices. Drugs are still a high point, but they deal primarily in crack, meth, PCP, and a surprising amount of ecstacy despite the other three so they can tap into the night lifers. They also have better connections than most: not only can they get their hands on some interesting things, but they know the right names and still have the right favors.%0a%3c %0a%3c Particularly dark reds mark them, preferably with a black background or highlights. Some wear custom printed t-shirts with a large crimson sun somewhere along them. Their weapons of choice are the traditional blades, razors, and shivs of the main Bloods, though they reserve them for people who need a reminder of who they really are.%0a%3c %0a%3c '''Leader:'''Michael Stone ''(CK Stone)''%0a%3c %0a%3c [--%25color=#365776%25[[#top| Back to top]]--] %0a%3c -----%0a%3c %0a%3c [[#SPEnd]]%0a%3c [[#BLEnd]]%0a%3c %0a%3c [[#CR]]%0a%3c !Crips%0a%3c **[[#BMC|Blue Magic Crips]]%0a%3c **[[#TMGE|Tri-Megas]]%0a%3c **[[#OG|Old Ghosts]]%0a%3c %0a%3c [[#BMC]]%0a%3c '''Blue Magic Crips'''%0a%3c %0a%3c '''Nicknames:''' ''Blues, Magics, Stars.''%0a%3c %0a%3c Though the underworld is inherently dark and terrible, the Blue Magics have the most popular image. They've been around and stable for a lot longer than most sets, with major players at least as old as the Sons of Piru, whom they consider their rivals. With their music, their money, and playing off a lighter side of their dealings, they strut the line between a happy public face and a much darker one behind closed doors.%0a%3c %0a%3c The Magics run the majority of the prostitution, and even take cuts in exchange for the promise of backup for people that aren't even in their territory. They also deal most heavily in party drugs and uppers like cocain, ecstacy, and all the rest. The popular image they like to show is the classic "pimps and hoes" look, but the reality of the situation is much darker, violent, and subjugating. The purchase of flesh and human trafficking is never happy business, even if everyone's smiling.%0a%3c %0a%3c Their territory isn't highly contested, if only because they don't really have to enforce much of it. The other gangs know they're a strong set and the Magics don't push much for official territory: they have enough tendrils to span what they need to.%0a%3c %0a%3c The Blue Magic Crips favor the strong blue shades typical of the main Crips. If there's a motif or jewelry, stars or burst shapes of any number of points are common, but six points are preferred. Their choice of weapons varies, as they tend to have the money to get what they need. There's a certain prestige to owning some kind of customized weapon that at least started as blunt, like a painted cane with a nice gem, or a bat with six nails sticking out.%0a%3c %0a%3c '''Leader:'''Gordon Prince ''(The Prince)''%0a%3c %0a%3c [--%25color=#365776%25[[#top| Back to top]]--] %0a%3c -----%0a%3c %0a%3c [[#BMCEnd]]%0a%3c %0a%3c [[#TMGE]]%0a%3c '''Tri-Megas'''%0a%3c %0a%3c The Tri-Megas are currently associated with the Blue Magic Crips, with enough power to be considered a minor but decent player among the Crips in general.%0a%3c %0a%3c See the Cult writeup for the Tri-Megas for more information!%0a%3c %0a%3c %0a%3c [--%25color=#365776%25[[#top| Back to top]]--] %0a%3c -----%0a%3c [[#TMGEEnd]]%0a%3c %0a%3c [[#OG]]%0a%3c '''Old Ghosts'''%0a%3c %0a%3c '''Nicknames:''' ''OG's, Ghosts.''%0a%3c %0a%3c The Old Ghosts are the only Asian Boyz set in the area, and though they're under the Crip banner they work mostly on a business level with the Magics. They've had to restructure several times due to attacks by the Bloods, and as a result have recently begun taking on members of more varied stripes than they're used to. Having learned from the gang fights that broke them down, their tactics have also changed to reflect it.%0a%3c %0a%3c They run drugs as many do, particularly exotic ones like opium. They're also decent smugglers of any and all things. The drugs keep them fairly rich, but the smuggling gets a lot of their money, too. Buyers will pay a lot for something old and foreign with the right story, but many are just as willing to buy in living things: exotic pets and exotic women are just as much for sale. Their smuggling and human trafficking works well with the Blue Magic Crips, whom are willing to pay quite a bit for equipment, interesting things, and women to keep their prostitution rings alive.%0a%3c %0a%3c OG territory is fairly varied but not always obviously marked: it's a fun strategy for them to tag odd places, then quote it as the reason for violent response. With the mysterious deaths that come from messing with the Ghosts in recent years, most gangs advise avoiding asian neighbourhoods in general or wearing something bulletproof.%0a%3c %0a%3c The Ghosts prefer dark gray or black to mark them, but allow for white highlights. Death imagery is common, all the better if it mixes with the common Asian Boyz imagery of dragons or crystals. Long knives, machetes, and short swords of various styles are their weapons of choice, but they also have occasional access to something automatic if they're trusted enough to keep it hidden.%0a%3c %0a%3c '''Leader:'''Mach Thi Loan  ''(OG Mack, Ghost Lady)''%0a%3c %0a%3c [--%25color=#365776%25[[#top| Back to top]]--] %0a%3c -----%0a%3c %0a%3c [[#OGEnd]]%0a%3c [[#CREnd]]%0a%3c %0a%3c [[#IN]]%0a%3c !Independents%0a%3c **[[#SSS|South Side Soldiers]]%0a%3c **[[#MS|Midnight Shakers]]%0a%3c **[[#BRC|Blackroot Coalition]]%0a%3c %0a%3c [[#SSS]]%0a%3c '''South Side Soldiers'''%0a%3c %0a%3c '''Nicknames:''' ''Trips (from "Triple-S"), 319's, Soldiers.''%0a%3c %0a%3c The Trips are a new gang, formed off the disenfranchised members of the Bloods and Crips during the fights that have formed the city's territory. They've locked off a section of the south despite their fewer numbers, but part of the reason they're still alive is because they aren't a main focus of the Bloods or the Crips. If they're ever going to take more territory or get richer, they need more guns to do it with.%0a%3c %0a%3c As for what keeps them afloat, the Trips deal in whatever illicit business they can, though it tends to stay fairly low-level just from the lack of connections. They continue to operate in southern neighbourhoods, promising businesses and sometimes entire streets to keep the Bloods & Crips out for the right sums of money. They keep that promise, but nowadays they're not much better than either group, and the money is now more along the lines of a protection scam that nobody's bold enough to point out.%0a%3c %0a%3c Trip territory is always clearly marked with their wispy triple-S either vertically or horizontally. Whatever their alignment, they tend to be followed by disrespectful signs and markings toward the Bloods and Crips or other poor sentiments.%0a%3c %0a%3c Their color tends to be orange, of whatever shades they can get. Images of guns and other soldier-ish weapons are common iconography, especially as tattoos - typically with a "319" on it where the serial number would be. They tend to enjoy similar weapons, picking up ka-bars and copies of gun models used in wars.%0a%3c %0a%3c '''Leader:'''Omar Santiago%0a%3c %0a%3c [--%25color=#365776%25[[#top| Back to top]]--] %0a%3c -----%0a%3c %0a%3c [[#SSSEnd]]%0a%3c %0a%3c [[#MS]]%0a%3c '''Midnight Shakers'''%0a%3c %0a%3c '''Nicknames:''' ''Shakers, MS, various insulting words.''%0a%3c %0a%3c The Midnight Shakers are particularly new, maybe six months in the game and without much known about them or any formal leader; this is mostly because they don't really announce themselves or have any formal colors. In fact, most of what they've done tends to get attributed to other gangs for a while due to their practice of wearing confusing gang colors for their operations. Like chameleons, they switch to whatever colors and imagery suit their needs for the night. Wearing the same or opposite colors as other gangs is great for selling drugs, distractions, muggings, and raids. They've even run a raid or two on the other gangs with their confusing attire. %0a%3c %0a%3c The truth of the matter, or at least what's said by the Shakers that have been asked what the hell they're doing before they "go missing," is that they're just looking to get what they need and keep the heat off them. They attribute the worst of their acts to a few of their more anarchistic members that are just starting things under the pretenses of distracting the other gangs or trying to point them at each other. Of course, that doesn't save them when they're caught.%0a%3c %0a%3c The Shakers themselves aren't run by any strong centralizing force. They have a leader, but they're not really the one running all ths shows. In fact, there are smaller groups within the set that go about their business under the same general laws and share the name.%0a%3c %0a%3c If the Shakers ever tag, it's with a capital "M" in straight vertical and horizontal lines (like a sideways E), with an S through the middle bar like a dollar sign.%0a%3c %0a%3c '''Leader:'''Unknown%0a%3c %0a%3c [--%25color=#365776%25[[#top| Back to top]]--] %0a%3c -----%0a%3c %0a%3c [[#MSEnd]]%0a%3c %0a%3c [[#BRC]]%0a%3c '''Blackroot Coalition'''%0a%3c %0a%3c %25Red%25(See the Cult writeup for the Coille for more information on the Blackroots!)%25%25%0a%3c %0a%3c The Blackroot Coalition seems to have popped up out of nowhere, with no particular area or group of people to call their own. Nobody on the streets are quite sure what their overall goals are, but they know they have a firm hold on a few parks and only deal with drugs found in nature. Ambrosia's the only real edge that have in the drug business; it's rare for them to sell the gold-red resin often, but its hallucinogenic effects are unique enough to have a few hippie buyers.%0a%3c %0a%3c The Blackroots aren't a very active gang in comparison to the others. In fact, they're almost off the map entirely, only taking up border territories and not enforcing them as harshly as other gangs might. There's no interconnection or history to speak of with them and the other gangs beyond some minor fist-fights.%0a%3c %0a%3c Their colors tend to be green with black highlights, especially in patterns with interconnected or wavy lines, though pure black is also acceptable. They tag urban areas with pro-nature slogans, sometimes attend Earth-Heart activities, and don't seem to do anything particularly rough... on the gang scene, anyway.%0a%3c %0a%3c %0a%3c '''Leader:'''Bradley Shaw%0a%3c %0a%3c [--%25color=#365776%25[[#top| Back to top]]--] %0a%3c -----%0a%3c [[#BRCEnd]]%0a%3c [[#GEnd]]%0a%3c %0a

They vye to reach the true heights of power that each individual can attain in their field ("realm") of choice, guided by intense heraldric totemism that glorifies their desired traits and focuses them into an image and legacy. To each Sovereign, every interaction is a struggle for dominance, and everything is a bargaining tool. All that ever matters is power: how much you have, how much you can get, and how much you can use. The internal structures of the Sovereigns constantly shift as a result of all the power-brokering and backstabbing that comes from these struggles, but they are nonetheless forces to be reckoned with. The only ties that bind them are a short list of rules called the Empyreal Accord, and the sheer power they all share.%0a%3c %0a%3c Joining the Sovereigns involves being sponsored and taught by another Sovereign to respect power first and foremost. After a degree of zealotry is proven, the initiate chooses a totem, makes a crest, then performs a short ritual (ask for details) and presentation of their crest to the other Sovereigns.%0a%3c %0a%3c '''Totem & Crest:''' Each Sovereign designs their own personal crest based on a totem animal of their choice, whether it's a living creature, an extinct one, or a mythological being. They characterize their totem however they wish, so long as it exemplifies the sort of power they seek; a wolf or bull might be chosen by a ruthless corporate CEO, while a bat or mouse might be chosen by backroom dealer in secrets.%0a%3c %0a%3c !!Empyreal Sovereign NPCs:%0a%3c %0a%3c '''Albert Wainwright:''' The Golden Eagle (Cult Leader)%0a%3c %0a%3c '''Jasmine Miller:''' The Whispering Bat (Intelligence Specialist)%0a%3c %0a%3c '''Kevin Barnes:''' The Mad Wolf (Blood Vice Gang Leader)%0a%3c %0a%3c %0a%3c !!How to become involved:%0a%3c %0a%3c Make one!

He's a man who maintains a physical and emotional distance from those he interact with, though, rumor says that he fell apart at the death of his eldest daughter, Eliza, some years ago. He's not a man eager to please, though, he does appreciate those that seek to curry his favor. %0a%3c %0a%3c In contrast to Archibald, his wife, Selene is more socially aware and forgiving. She's accustomed to the small chit-chat of business, as well as the small social exchanges that pass by without word. She's active in high society but has become less gaudy in her later years than she was previously. Recently, despite their active past of being impeccable hosts, the Sterling's have stepped away from hosting events at their lush estate and grounds.%0a%3c %0a%3c Sebastian Sterling, the heir apparent, is a man in his 30's whose returned to Georgia after nearly a decade away, presumably to assume his place as the leader of Sterling Industries. He's a man raised on country clubs and events, but seems entirely bored with it now. Rumors state that he was nearly a doctor before he returned back to the estate, an interesting pursuit given what the families main investments are. Frequently he's seen around town, rather than within the confines of the large family estate. %0a%3c %0a%3c Finally, there is Patia Sterling, the youngest daughter of the Sterling line. Strangely, though her mother is active in socialite and high society events, Patia isn't. Instead, she is known as something of a recluse, oftentimes only being spotted at events that take place within her families estate and grounds. She's a pretty girl in her 20's, but in the brief encounters that acquaintances have with her, they always state that something seems 'off' about the girl. Rumors at times are known to follow Patia, and the particularly vicious ones state that she's known to bounce in and out of mental health facilities and rehabilitation houses. %0a%3c %0a%3c '''How To Become Involved:'''%0a%3c %0a%3c If your character is involved in the ''finances'' or ''High Society'' world, they may know a Sterling or two.

William Taylor, a commanding and frugal businessman, was able to turn his run down inheritance of broken buildings into a modernization of Savannah’s nightclub and entertainment scene. %0a%3c %0a%3c Originally a small family owned construction business, known for their excellent restorations and handiwork, the Taylor family has founded Marquee Savannah within the local entertainment sector. From cigar bars to Blues Joints, The Taylor’s own 4 of Savannah’s hottest clubs, an art gallery, and the Fall of 2013 announces the opening of their new restaurant “Marquee”. %0a%3c %0a%3c Philanthropists, the Taylor family works with the Savannah Community towards a vision of a sleek and modern tomorrow which melds the historical architecture of the city. Natasha Taylor, works primarily with volunteer organizations to help coordinate events at the Taylor venues. Meanwhile, William Taylor runs weekend long seminars to help the poor and lower middle class learn about smart investing and how to start a small business. %0a%3c %0a%3c %0a%3c '''About The Taylor Family:''' '-(OOC)-'%0a%3c %0a%3c '''William Taylor:''' The Baron%0a%3c %0a%3c '''Natasha Taylor:''' The Second Wife%0a%3c %0a%3c '''Trisha Taylor:''' The Snoop%0a%3c %0a%3c '''Dwayne Taylor:''' Bon Vivant%0a%3c %0a%3c The Taylor family is associated with so much of Savannah’s culture, that it’s particularly easier to say what they aren’t involved with. %0a%3c %0a%3c William Taylor is a prominent and middle aged man who tries to use the gossip columns pre-occupation with his family to his advantage. He’s charismatic, boisterous and friendly, and given all the money he donates into local philanthropist organizations, he’s often seen in a saintly light. There’s rumors that his business practices are a whole lot less winsome, but often, these rumors are fought by the kinder stories of his community involvement, including the seminars he often runs. Personable, he’ll offer anyone a seat at his table, and is ingratiated into the culture of Savannah, oftentimes dining locally or having a drink at a local bar.%0a%3c %0a%3c Natasha Taylor is William Taylor’s second wife, though his first, Connie, is rarely ever seen. Natasha, 30, is a failed model, a failed fashion designer and a failed interior designer, but she’s excelling at being social eye candy. She takes full advantage of the Taylor nightclubs and is known for her parties in equal measure to her fundraisers, Natasha, is a woman who’s almost always having an event. Rumor has it that Natasha’s trying to break into the upper echelons of Savannah society.%0a%3c %0a%3c Trisha Taylor is William’s oldest child and is a recent graduate of Savannah State University, in Journalism. She stays detached from her families affairs, though the media is prone to mentioning her in their society columns. She currently works for Savannah Morning News, and can be spotted around town sleuthing for stories. %0a%3c %0a%3c Dwayne Taylor is the youngest and is barely 20, though that doesn't stop him from drinking in his father’s clubs. He’s known for his antics, which often are plastered across the gossip columns. He’s known for his excess and womanizing and at times can be seen attempting to fit in with harder, street affiliated friends.%0a%3c  %0a%3c '''How to become involved:'''%0a%3c %0a%3c If your character is involved in the nightlife, arts or high society world, they may know the Taylor’s.

The American dream unfurled, they began as a modest immigrant family in Augusta, Georgia in 1880. Their modest business of family owned funeral homes grew through hard work and generational progress. Slowly, their name stretched across the state, before finally becoming a powerhouse in the South. %0a%3c %0a%3c Though previously seen as a dark and macabre profession, the funeral industry has changed over the years as modernism set in. Gone are the home viewings and used coffins, and incoming are the sleek silk lined coffins of tomorrow, certified to maintain seal for half a century through the miracle of science. Funerals have shifted from small religious gatherings to an anesthetized gathering of individuals to honor the idea of life, rather than death. With these progressive changes, Sterling Industries has changed too. Gone is the image of a mom and pop business, and in,is the Sterling Industries sterile brand, pioneered by the reigning patriarch Frances- Archibald Sterling. %0a%3c %0a%3c Though, the Sterling families largest acquisition is the fleet of funeral homes that litter the South, they also maintain a hefty stock market portfolio which holds large slices of recognizable companies in a variety of business sectors, ensuring that their fingers are in almost all of the monetary pies in Georgia.%0a%3c [[#SterlingF]]%0a%3c '+About The Sterling Family :+' '-(OOC)-'%0a%3c %0a%3c '''Frances-Archibald Sterling:''' The Reigning Patriarch%0a%3c %0a%3c '''Selene Sterling-Montgomery:''' The Reigning Matriarch%0a%3c %0a%3c '''Eliza Sterling:''' In Memorium%0a%3c %0a%3c '''Sebastian Sterling:''' The Prodigal Son%0a%3c %0a%3c '''Patia Sterling:''' In Pieces.%0a%3c %0a%3c Frances-Archibald is the domineering patriarch of the Sterling lineage. He was born for the role of the patriarch, and summarily groomed throughout his entire life to ensure the success of his industry as well as his family. He's a man who maintains a physical and emotional distance from those he interact with, though, rumor says that he fell apart at the death of his eldest daughter, Eliza, some years ago. He's not a man eager to please, though, he does appreciate those that seek to curry his favor. %0a%3c %0a%3c In contrast to Archibald, his wife, Selene is more socially aware and forgiving. She's accustomed to the small chit-chat of business, as well as the small social exchanges that pass by without word. She's active in high society but has become less gaudy in her later years than she was previously. Recently, despite their active past of being impeccable hosts, the Sterling's have stepped away from hosting events at their lush estate and grounds.%0a%3c %0a%3c Sebastian Sterling, the heir apparent, is a man in his 30's whose returned to Georgia after nearly a decade away, presumably to assume his place as the leader of Sterling Industries. He's a man raised on country clubs and events, but seems entirely bored with it now. Rumors state that he was nearly a doctor before he returned back to the estate, an interesting pursuit given what the families main investments are. Frequently he's seen around town, rather than within the confines of the large family estate. %0a%3c %0a%3c Finally, there is Patia Sterling, the youngest daughter of the Sterling line. Strangely, though her mother is active in socialite and high society events, Patia isn't. Instead, she is known as something of a recluse, oftentimes only being spotted at events that take place within her families estate and grounds. She's a pretty girl in her 20's, but in the brief encounters that acquaintances have with her, they always state that something seems 'off' about the girl. Rumors at times are known to follow Patia, and the particularly vicious ones state that she's known to bounce in and out of mental health facilities and rehabilitation houses. %0a---%0a> !!!Lineages%0a> !!Sterling Lineage%0a> *[[#Sterling|The Sterlings]]%0a

diff:1377895053:1377893193:=21,40c21%0a%3c %0a%3c In 1773, General James Oglethorpe and 120 passengers of the good ship “Anne”  landed on a bluff along the Savannah River.  Oglethrope named the 13th and final American colony “Georgia” after England’s King George II, Savannah became its first city. %0a%3c %0a%3c Savannah initially began as a colony which allowed free worship, but banned rum, lawyers and slavery. The city offered a new start for England’s working poor and strengthened the colonies by increasing trade. Additionally, it was chartered as a buffer zone for South Carolina protecting it from the advancement of the Spanish in Florida.%0a%3c %0a%3c The beginning of Savannah’s history was peaceful, as Oglethorpe had received permission from the local Yamacraw Native Americans to settle in the area now known as Savannah. Due to the lack of warfare, Savannah flourished.  As America’s first planned city, the city boasts 22 of the 24 original city squares. %0a%3c %0a%3c The peace within Savannah was shattered during 1778, which it was held by the British until 1782. In 1792, a land-sea force of French and Americans tried to retake the city, but failed. After regaining its independence, Savannah once again flourished, and farmers found that the soil was rich with minerals and the climate was favorable for cultivation of rice and cotton.  Plantations of slavery soon became highly profitable systems amidst Georgia and Carolina. During this time, Savannah worked as a port for the trans-Atlantic slave trade.%0a%3c %0a%3c With their new found wealth by cotton, residents built lavish homes and churches throughout the city. After the invention of the cotton gin outside of Savannah, the city rivaled Charleston as a commercial port.  But misfortune struck in 1796 and 1820 as half of Savannah burned in ashes, both times. %0a%3c %0a%3c The serenity within Savannah was destroyed with the start of the civil war. During the war, the city suffered from sea blockades so strict that the economy cumbled. “Impregnable” Fort Pulaski, was captured by Union soldiers in 1862. The city itself did not fall until mid-December, after General William Tucemseh burned down the city of Atlanta. On December 22nd, 1864, the General sent President Abraham Lincoln a telegram, offering the city as a Christmas present. %0a%3c %0a%3c After the Civil War, the Reconstruction period began. Food was scarce as the economy remained in ruins. During this time, freed slaves who remained in Savannah built a thriving community, with its own churches, schools and economic strength. Savannah became one of the most historically significant African-American cities in the nation. %0a%3c At the turn of the 20th century, cotton, resin and lumber became economically strong once again. Unfortunately, during the Great Depression an infestation of boll weevils came and destroyed most of these crops, alongside the state’s economy.%0a%3c %0a%3c In today’s world, Savannah is a strong city with a diverse economy of manufacturing, hospitality, industry, military, high education, health care and retail. A tourist attraction, in 2008, more than 6.15 million people stayed in the city and spent more than 1.9 billion. In 2004, retail sales totaled more than 4.5 billion.%0a%3c %0a%3c Savannah is also home to Savannah State University, one of America’s oldest African-American universities, the acclaimed Savannah College of Art and Design, and 8 more universities.  In addition, its home to one of the largest southeast seaports and works as a distribution point for a 26-state region, and 75 percent of the country.  %0a%3c %0a---%0a> WIP%0a

Every lens is focusing, and every revealed story leaks more of the unfathomable truth. %0a%3c %0a%3c For nearly 200 years, Savannah has relied on print media as its primary source. The printing press, in the hands of the affluent few, was the sole producer of the cities only newspapers. As a consequence, a monopoly of news agencies took hold of the city. Information was controlled by an exclusive hierarchy of journalists and their editors, and in turn, a mirage of truth was cultivated on the front pages of these newspapers. %0a%3c %0a%3c The 21st century has given way to a new technology, the internet, which contests the antiqued hold that these companies maintain within Savannah. Already, the venerable Savannah Evening News has fallen, and its sister newspaper, The Savannah Morning News, finds its subscription base falling. In an attempt of siphoning the hemorrhaging, the newspaper has attempted to modernize itself, to present a sleeker and younger appearance. %0a%3c %0a%3c In conjunction to the threat that is the internet, technology continues to march forward. With the advancement of cell phones and digital cameras, it’s difficult to control the torrent of information before it reaches the blogs and indie media found on the internet.  The thick and dusty curtain within Savannah is peeling back with every amateur photographer, with every truth seeker, and soon the hidden belly of the city will be revealed. All it takes is the right shot, the right story, and the right place at the right time. %0a%3c %0a%3c '''Current News Agencies:'''%0a%3c %0a%3c *Savannah Morning News%0a%3c *DoSavannah%0a%3c %0a

Reminders of it cultivate a dogmatic society of tradition, splintered by the families who try to bury the shame of their past, and the families who exalt within it. %0a%3c In ages past, Savannah was a city of Southern romantic tradition, with all of the trappings that came with it. Southern Belles were debuted in lavish displays of affluence; the landed gentry cultivated a theatrical ideal of honor, even going so far as to adopt the Code Duello to enact their vengeance. Monied family names became legacies of tradition and legend, while their prejudices continued to divide a city and world.%0a%3c %0a%3c Though the preserved streets of Savannah are left unchanged, the cultural landscape of the city is transforming. Legacies fueled by their old money are finding their gilded cages cracking as a new generation of affluence rises into the upper echelons of their world. Beneath the veneer of polite society hides the menacing world of haughty gossip and deadly rivalries. The upcoming conflicts of Savannah’s society will dictate whether tradition is proven to be long lasting, if it can evolve for a changing world or if it will be torn asunder by the future.%0a%3c %0a%3c Members of High Society will not only need to navigate the treacherous dangers of their entangled world, but also have to face the challenges beseeched upon them by an increasingly obsessed world of hungry paparazzo’s and a voyeuristic world that is continuously waiting for their slip up.%0a%3c '''%25white%25Locations%25%25'''%0a%3c [[#Location]]%0a%3c *[[#Noble|Noble Fare]]%0a%3c *[[#Landing|The Landing]]%0a%3c *[[#SG|The Savannah Golf Club]]%0a%3c -----%0a%3c %0a%3c %0a%3c [[#Noble]]%0a%3c !!Noble Fare%0a%3c ''Jefferson and Harris''%0a%3c %0a%3c ''"Locally inspired cuisine with modern taste and historic charm"''%0a%3c %0a%3c Located in the heart of the Historic District, Noble Fair is an exclusive restaurant and wine bar.
