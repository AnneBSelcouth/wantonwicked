He talks as one who always thinks first, mulls the words over, then speaks in a precariously articulate fashion that just almost succeeds in negating a Jersey accent. With him, one can hardly tell when the realms of earnestness and severity pass into humor due to the monotone form in which he speaks. But it's hard enough even trying to remember precisely what his dour countenance looks like until he's standing right in front of you once his trademark stare chooses to intrude on you. Even the Shadow's name requires some effort and concentration to conjure from the cloud of memory where images and stimuli of more relevance jostle to take his place.

Whatever their higher calling may be hasn't been discussed openly, even by outsiders who have arrived on their streets seeking their recondite services.

He talks as one who always thinks first, mulls the words over, then speaks in a precariously articulate fashion that just almost succeeds in negating a Jersey accent. With him, one can hardly tell when the realms of earnestness and severity pass into humor due to the monotone form in which he speaks. But it's hard enough even trying to remember precisely what his dour countenance looks like until he's standing right in front of you once his trademark stare chooses to intrude on you. Even the Shadow's name requires some effort and concentration to conjure from the cloud of memory where images and stimuli of more relevance jostle to take his place. A life on very thin ice, existing between the cracks of society.''%0a---%0a> ''His features somewhat bear the effect of being under soft, and the telltale signs of a mental state of psychic immiseration manifest in the way his posture is prone slouching and appearing sapped of energy and crumpled.
