She is obviously a girl that takes care of herself and her appearance - almost obsessively. Her long chocolate hair is, for the most part, simply left to fall to her elbows in soft layers and loose tousled waves, though often it is pulled back in a ponytail for work. Her face is then further characterized by a cherub-like mouth and large expressive almond-shaped green eyes that are accentuated by shadow of black or purple and framed by long thick dramatic lashes.%0a%0a%25color=#996633%25Jaz's normal attire consists of slacks or modest dresses under a white labcoat.
