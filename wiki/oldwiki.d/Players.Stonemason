He has the build of someone that has done intense physical labor all of his life, rather than goes to the gym to work out. Likewise, his hands are rough and covered with nicks and scars. His face is handsome, but with a friendly, open smile. His hair could often use a cut (and a good wash), long somewhat shaggy locks that border between light brown and dark blonde. He wear fairly casual clothing, which usually consists of flannels along with jeans and work boots. Ones that are more functional than fashionable. He's often a little dirty as well. %0a%0aWhen using magic, things around him seem to become more solid, more ageless. His skin turns dusty and dirty. During strong magic his skin may appear to turn to stone all together, and his features take on the aspect of every human being alive, just for a second, from the lowest to the highest, provoking a moment of recognition in everyone.%0a%0a%0ahttp://wantonwicked.gamingsandbox.com/wiki/images/mta/headers/mta_h.png%0aMason has only lived in Savannah for about a year and a half. When he first moved here from Tennessee, he went by the shadowname -Sullivan-. At that point he was an Apostate, and floundered when he found himself in the middle of his first Consilium. But he found his footing soon enough, and ended up being recruited into the Silver Ladder. He's still an Acolyte however, not yet having found what place within the Order he'd like to serve. %0a%0aSeveral months ago he joined the ancient legacy called the Tamers of Stone. Since then he has gone by his current shadowname, -Stonemason-. Since then he has become more proficient with Matter and Space magic, along with studying geomancy. %0a%0a%0ahttp://wantonwicked.gamingsandbox.com/wiki/images/mta/headers/mta_rph.png%0a'''Silver Ladder''': Mason was recruited into the Silver Ladder a little over a year ago. Perhaps you had a hand in that, if you're a Ladder as well. Perhaps you were one that reached out to him and taught him about the Consilium? %0a%0a'''Hallow Bloodhound''': Because of his legacy, Mason is very skilled at finding hallows. It's almost second nature to him. If you need any help finding one, he's a good person to call. Likewise, if you're a fellow student of geomancy and leylines, he'd definitely be up for chatting with you. %0a%0a'''Construction Yard''': Mason works for a local construction company. He's a teamleader, usually managing a team to build or renovate a specific project. Making sure that things get done, as well as designing some of the architecture needed. But he's not afraid to get dirty as well, and does a fair amount of physical labor too. If you need a job (Even a temp one) and don't mind working hard, he'll probably hook you up. The company focuses mostly on housing and public buildings, places that people will use and cherish. They're affordable, and sometimes have need based pricing. It's not unusual for them to work cheap for people in need, such as helping to rebuild a home after it's burnt down, or some other tragic accident. %0a%0a'''Friends Around Town''': Mason is a very down to earth Ladder, and believes that everyone is equal, including Sleepers. While he might find some of his fellow Ladders a little too pompous, he does try to be useful for the Order. He makes it a point of making useful friends. If you're a cop, or work within city hall in some form, or have pull within work unions, odds are that he's bought you a drink and chatted with you some. He's not obnoxious about it though, and seems like a pretty nice guy. %0a%0a%0ahttp://wantonwicked.gamingsandbox.com/wiki/images/mta/headers/mta_q.png%0a''"A quote"'' - [[Someone]]%0a[[%3c%3c]]%0a%0a(:include CityBook.MageNavigationBar:)
