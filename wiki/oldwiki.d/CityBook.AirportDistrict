It was formerly known as Savannah International Airport, Travis Field and Chatham Field. The airport is just off Interstate 95, between Savannah and the city of Pooler, Georgia. It is the chief commercial airport for the three-county Savannah metropolitan area, although nearly 40 percent of the airport's total passenger traffic is bound for Hilton Head Island, South Carolina, located approximately 38.5 miles (approx. 42 minutes) away by car.%0a%25lfloat text-align=center margin-top=5px margin-right=15px margin-bottom=5px margin-left=0px width=250px%25[[http://wantonwicked.gamingsandbox.com/wiki/images/city/Airport2.JPG|http://wantonwicked.gamingsandbox.com/wiki/images/city/Airport2.JPG]]%0aThis airport is included in the National Plan of Integrated Airport Systems for 2011–2015, which categorized it as a primary commercial service airport since it has over 10,000 passenger boarding (enplanements) per year. As per Federal Aviation Administration records, the airport had 785,251 enplanements in calendar year 2011, a decrease of 1.62%25 from 798,194 in 2010.%0aDespite the airport's name, there are currently no scheduled commercial international flights outside the United States from Savannah/Hilton Head. However, U.S. Customs facilities are on the field and the airport is part of a Foreign Trade Zone. As of 2003, Savannah/Hilton Head had 96,816 annual operations (takeoffs and landings) and 887,095 passenger enplanements, making it second only to Hartsfield-Jackson Atlanta International Airport as Georgia's busiest commercial airport.%0aA terminal expansion project was completed in July 2007, adding five departure gates (for a total of fifteen). A $35 million parking garage was completed in October of the same year, which added 1,700 parking spaces and uses an electronic program to alert drivers to the number of available spaces on each garage level.%0aThe Airport is patrolled by the Savannah/Hilton Head International Airport Police, who work alongside the TSA to provide airport security.%0aSavannah/Hilton Head is served by Delta (along with Delta Connection carrier Shuttle America), United Airlines, US Airways, and American Eagle. An information counter provides local information regarding not only tourist attractions in Savannah and Hilton Head but most other coastal areas of Georgia and southern South Carolina.%0aThe airport serves as world headquarters for Gulf Stream Aerospace. The Georgia Air National Guard's 165th Airlift Wing is also based at Savannah/Hilton Head International.%0a%0a!!Pooler%0aAlong Highway 80 is one of the fastest growing cities in Georgia: Pooler. Old foundations are being shaken by the influx of commercial development. In contrast to the “old money” that oils the machine that runs Savannah, Pooler is driven by the zeitgeist of progression. New money is the only currency in high demand, and the city has an insatiable appetite for it.%0a%0aIn merely a decade the population of the city has nearly tripled, and with it the demand for an excess of the staples of American consumer culture. Chain restaurant follows chain restaurant along Pooler Parkway. Department stores seem to crop up nearly overnight. Amidst the constant construction projects are the armies of laborers toiling to bring the modern way of life to these once rural residents.%0a%0aAmongst the citizens are talks of the terms Old Pooler & New Pooler. No longer is it merely a geographical term to describe the rapid development around the area. Now they've become terms to describe those who claim the city as their own. Were you here before it got big? Are your roots firmly planted? You must be Old Pooler. Are you here just to make a buck? Got here after the big time rush? You must be New Pooler. Each term means something different depending on which circles you travel in.%0a%0aThe politicians, unlike their peers in neighboring cities, welcome the change. They rub elbows with the big developers. From The real estate moguls, the million-dollar contractors and the corporations looking for headquarters, Pooler has it all. Gulf Stream, a major aeronautics company was a key player in turning the spotlight towards the city. Since its arrival, other large corporations have sought to call Pooler home. Even a half-million square foot Georgia Outlet Mall has recently begun construction. %0a%0aPooler is the town where the dying American Dream of Savannah can come to be reborn anew. As such a lot of the well-to-do of Savannah have migrated to the city. And they've come in droves. If you can make it here your wallet can speak louder than you words, so long as it’s deep enough. Beyond it's superficial facade, however, are the same problems affecting the South and the nation as a whole: an economic class divide that comes with the torrent of economic stimulus. Despite this, you will hear no cries from the poverty-stricken underclass. Is it because they are content? Is it because they don't exist? Or is it because they've been silenced by the forces of the moneyed elite? Who can say? This is Pooler, after all.%0a%0a!!District Features:%0a>>lrindent frame border='1px solid #898989' bgcolor=#eeeeee padding=15px%3c%3c%0a'''City/Mortal''':%0a>>%3c%3c%0a%0a>>lrindent frame border='1px solid #005826' bgcolor=#eeeeee padding=15px%3c%3c%0a'''Changeling''':%0a>>%3c%3c%0a%0a>>lrindent frame border='1px solid #003471' bgcolor=#eeeeee padding=15px%3c%3c%0a'''Mage''':%0a>>%3c%3c%0a%0a>>lrindent frame border='1px solid #9e0b0f' bgcolor=#eeeeee padding=15px%3c%3c%0a'''Vampire''':%0a* Domain of [[Players/Anna Tisdale]], Ordo Dracul%0a* Location Rating: 3%0a>>%3c%3c%0a%0a>>lrindent frame border='1px solid #74483f' bgcolor=#eeeeee padding=15px%3c%3c%0a'''Werewolf''':%0a>>%3c%3c%0a%0a!!District Locations:%0a(:sortable align=center:)%0a||class=sortable id=SGLocations%0a||!Location||!Venue||!Owner||%0a||[[CityBook.CoastalStatePrison|Coastal State Prison]]||[[Players.Mage|Mage]]||[[Seers of the Throne]]||%0a(:tableend:)%0a%0a----%0a(:include CityBook.Directory:)
