Despite his rugged rancher-like appearance, he's been known to clean up nicely and is equally at home in a suit as he is in a pair of urban clothing like jeans sagging past his ass only if necessary. %0a%3c %0a%3c In his Gauru form, Marcus is a walking nightmare of color and trinkets. A red stripe runs down the center of his head to the base of his neck where it splinters off into two orange tribal markings over his shoulder blades. From his shoulders, his arms are covered in white tribal markings that spiral over his biceps, forearms and end at his wrists. His chest sports a massive patch of white fur in the shape of a cross. His lower half is an insane mass of spiraling blue tribal lines that end at his ankles. A blue rabbit's foot hangs from his neck in all forms a he keeps various trinkets and trophies dangling from his fur such as rodent skulls, finger bones, bullet casings and a few human teeth it would appear, though no one has gotten close enough to confirm that.%0a---%0a> ''Marcus stands about 6'3'' with an athletic build. He keeps his hair an average length and sometimes sports a small amount of facial hair. He has a complete and total lack of scars or tattoos with the exception of a Marine Corps Coat of Arms in honor of his brother. He favors rugged, utilitarian clothing like denim, canvas, and leather but can be spotted sometimes in more urban attire, or even a suit if the occasion calls for it.%0a> %0a> Despite his completely unmarred outward appearance, Marcus has a very short temper and a very well earned reputation for extreme violence and bloodlust even for a werewolf.%0a
