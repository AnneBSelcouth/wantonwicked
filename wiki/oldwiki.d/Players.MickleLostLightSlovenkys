When we approach them it is not gold and alabaster but rotted, pitted wood.  [[http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CAuw1fu3jAw|But, we are a practical people.]]  We break down the statues for heat, use them for shelter; we try to make the ends fit together again for something...

Our '''juche''' had replaced the need for their doctrine and it was explained that our peoples souls were boundlessly apart.  We would never truly understand them and they would never understand us as they were another form of the corrupted, capitalist policies of the West.  Only one other person has made me question myself like this before.'' -- [[StephanieKim|Stephanie Kim]]%0a
