She grew up an only child in a middle-class household, and her home life was normal, and dare we say, happy.  However, at a young age, she became fascinated with the local urban legends.

Her mother despaired that she'd be killed, or, worse, arrested.%0a-> Her earlier passion never truly left, but it got supplanted by feminist theory at age 13, right around when she hit puberty.  It began a school career fraught with arguments with teachers--moreso the male than female, but there were a few notable backwards female teachers that drove her nuts--and detentions.  Those settled down by high school, though, and instead of arguing, she worked to subtly educate her educators.  It often didn't work, but she tried her hardest anyway.%0a-> After getting into [[CityBook.WhitefieldUniversity|Whitefield University]], she and her first serious boyfriend got frisky one night and watched some of [[Randy Van Horn|Randy Van Horn's]] porn.  She'd looked at stills before, but was game for trying out some of the videos, despite the inherent anti-feminism in the industry.  It fascinated her; not only was it hot as hell, but there was something about the man in question that caught her attention beside the obvious.  She began to collect his videos, feeling some admittedly screwed up connection to him.  She got into Film and Feminist Theory her second year, after being Undeclared her first, to figure out how to make female-friendly, less degrading pornography for those who might be interested in it.  To keep her body in shape as well as her mind, she joined the cross-country team.%0a->  Now, she's hoping to learn to direct, learning to write scripts--because story is Very Important to her--and to study porn from a director's viewpoint.  She also really hopes to meet Randy Van Horn, because he's become her twisted hero.%0a->'''*NOTE*''' - While Amanda is interested in porn and has a screwed up crush on a porn star, it doesn't mean that I'm interested in cybersex.
