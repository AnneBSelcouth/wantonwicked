The bearded lady has a curvy and attractive figure. She always wears full length dresses, make up, and enticing perfumes.%0a%0a'''Mien'''%0a%0aThe bearded lady is not a Lost.%0a%0a'''''The Red Mime'''''   %0aScout for the Carnival of Dreams%0a	'''MASK'''%0aThis man is tall, and lanky. He wears pristine white slacks with white loafers and socks, a white t-shirt tucked into his slacks the hugs his athletic frame, and white gloves. His hair is a shock white color that is wild and unkempt. His skin, along the arms face and neck is painted a glaring white like a mime, with his eyes and lips painted a vibrant red. His eyes are colored with bright red contacts%0a%0a	'''MIEN'''%0aTo the eyes of those who can see, his skin and hair are naturally white, and glows a bit, leaving trails of white along in his wake as he moves. His eyes and lips are entirely red and have a soft glow to them. When he smiles though, he can take on an unconsciously sinister cast as his teeth are somewhat crooked, pointy, and a tinged yellow color, as if he had smoked all his life; or simply not brushed his teeth much (if ever).%0a%0a''Personality''%0aThe Red Mime is slippery; in tongue, deed, and action, rarely making promises that somehow have no escape, and likes to double talk, and never say anything overly direct. He is not prone to being snippy, or insulting others, preferring to be coy, and laugh at others internally. The more he can say in less words, especially ion words that might be taken several ways, the better.%0a%0a'''''The Surveyor'''''%0aPlacement of the Carnival of Dreams%0a	'''MASK'''%0aThis small dwarf is a rotund piece of work, almost rolling and waddling when he moves  more than walking. He is round, with a long bushy beard that covers most of his torso and smells like he hasn't been acquainted with a bath in some time. His breath stinks of alcohol, though he is never seen to drink anything, not even water. His clothes. Overalls work boots and t-shirt, are much like the rest of himself. Shabby, worn, with dirt and soot stains. He is never seen without a rather large backpack on his shoulders that clanks when he walks. He carries a 4 foot long walking stick in hand which he ues to brace himself when he walks.%0a%0a	'''MIEN'''%0aHis mien clacks and groans when he moves, as his round form is entirely made of wood. His bush beard grows even longer and drags the ground to one side, and is made up of Spanish moss, that many have seen hedge birds living in, as they tend to peek out and sing at the oddest of moments. His eyes are made of a semi solid sap that tends to run down his wooden cheeks at the tear ducts. His hair is made up of long leaves entwined with sticks. His teeth when he smiles are made of pine bark, and clearly seem to be rotting, and worse when he shows them. Whoever he is looking at is washed over with the purtid smell on his breath of rotting sap. His walking stick is actually a very shiny clean and straight steel pole, with a wickedly sharp point at one and, that reminds one if might just well be able to slide through stone. His backpack clanks when he moves, and groans at time, tools can be seen imprinted on its surface from the inside, a pickaxe small shovel and innumerable screwdrivers of various types hang from tassels around the backpack. Sometimes the backpack itself will utters some around, or a cough, making it abundantly clear it is not just a normal backpack.%0a%0a''Personality''%0aThe Surveyor is a jerk. He's smelly and repugnant, and he knows it. His physical characteristics match his personality. He is lecherous, and verbally abusive, and likes to cuss, going out of his way to be curt,  and rude. And he HATES to explain himself, expecting people top simply act when he says they should. If has has to be nice to get what he wants he does it in as condescending a manner as he can. Really dislikes people with alternate sexual orientation, and always assumes they are trying to violate him sexually. And will consistently accuses people of such deviance until it's absolutely proven they are not that “way”. He particularly like insulting people he thinks of like that in the rudest and meanest way he can think of. He truly enjoys the confusion and discontentment using the carnival language brings and will talk incessantly in it just to be rude to those who do not understand it.%0a%0a'''''Ubu''''' (Automaton)%0aThe Surveyors pet%0aUnder normal circumstances this is simply a rather large musty backpack, that can physically store many things far too large to actually fit inside it*. But at times, it can change; becoming a large burlap sackcloth creature over 9 feet in height, with many teeth in its maw made up of various sharp and brutal looking tools. In this form it has no mask to hide it's presence form the sight of normal people.%0a%0a*Think T.A.R.D.I.S.%0a%0a'''''The Hawker'''''%0a%25center%25http://i1080.photobucket.com/albums/j337/siliconblend/Carnival%2520of%2520Dreams/T2eC16ZQFIbRtQUFVBSNi5Qjn60_35_zps5af66ef1.jpg%0a%0a''Personality''%0aThe Hawker is self important and assumes he is far more powerful than he really is, when in the company of the Carnival and it's members. When away form the Carnival and peers, he becomes a whinging coward constantly afraid someone will stab him in the back or otherwise roast him alive. He grovels and snivels like the finest of cowards in these situations.

He wears pristine white slacks with white loafers and socks, a white t-shirt tucked into his slacks the hugs his athletic frame, and white gloves. His hair is a shock white color that is wild and unkempt. His skin, along the arms face and neck is painted a glaring white like a mime, with his eyes and lips painted a vibrant red. His eyes are colored with bright red contacts%0a%3c %0a%3c 	MIEN%0a%3c To the eyes of those who can see, his skin and hair are naturally white, and glows a bit, leaving trails of white along in his wake as he moves. His eyes and lips are entirely red and have a soft glow to them. When he smiles though, he can take on an unconsciously sinister cast as his teeth are somewhat crooked, pointy, and a tinged yellow color, as if he had smoked all his life; or simply not brushed his teeth much (if ever).%0a%3c %0a%3c The Surveyor%0a%3c Placement of the Carnival of Dreams%0a%3c 	MASK%0a%3c This small dwarf is a rotund piece of work, almost rolling and waddling when he moves  more than walking. He is round, with a long bushy beard that covers most of his torso and smells like he hasn't been acquainted with a bath in some time. His breath stinks of alcohol, though he is never seen to drink anything, not even water. His clothes. Overalls work boots and t-shirt, are much like the rest of himself. Shabby, worn, with dirt and soot stains. He is never seen without a rather large backpack on his shoulders that clanks when he walks. He carries a 4 foot long walking stick in hand which he ues to brace himself when he walks.%0a%3c %0a%3c 	MIEN%0a%3c His mien clacks and groans when he moves, as his round form is entirely made of wood. His bush beard grows even longer and drags the ground to one side, and is made up of Spanish moss, that many have seen hedge birds living in, as they tend to peek out and sing at the oddest of moments. His eyes are made of a semi solid sap that tends to run down his wooden cheeks at the tear ducts. His hair is made up of long leaves entwined with sticks. His teeth when he smiles are made of pine bark, and clearly seem to be rotting, and worse when he shows them. Whoever he is looking at is washed over with the purtid smell on his breath of rotting sap. His walking stick is actually a very shiny clean and straight steel pole, with a wickedly sharp point at one and, that reminds one if might just well be able to slide through stone. His backpack clanks when he moves, and groans at time, tools can be seen imprinted on its surface from the inside, a pickaxe small shovel and innumerable screwdrivers of various types hang from tassels around the backpack. Sometimes the backpack itself will utters some around, or a cough, making it abundantly clear it is not just a normal backpack.%0a%3c %0a%3c Ubu (Automaton)%0a%3c The Surveyors pet%0a%3c Under normal circumstances this is simply a rather large musty backpack, that can physically store many things far too large to actually fit inside it*. But at times, it can change; becoming a large burlap sackcloth creature over 9 feet in height, with many teeth in its maw made up of various sharp and brutal looking tools. In this form it has no mask to hide it's presence form the sight of normal people.%0a%3c %0a%3c *Think T.A.R.D.I.S.%0a%3c %0a%3c %0a%3c THE TAROT DECK%0a%3c %0a%3c - MECHANICS/FLUFF%0a%3c %0a%3c The cards being passed out are larger than your typical playing card, and made of a heavy card stock that resists bending somewhat.

Each card is a work of art unto itself, and seems likely to be quite expensive.%0a%3c %0a%3c To fae eyes, and those with the ability to see, the cards in the hands of the lost/hobs/fae, rain with a soft glowing silver fairy dust* that vanishes a few inches form the card. In the hands of non-fae the dust dopes not appear.%0a%3c %0a%3c * This dust cannot be gathered as it vanishes soon after falling form the card. When in the open, and not concealed the falling dust makes it impossible to hide the card from eyes that can see. Standing out somewhat like a beacon to such forms of sight.%0a%3c %0a%3c The card in and of itself has a very minor magical “feel” to it this comes more from it being a pre-prepared receptacle for something magical, than being entirely magical on it's own.%0a%3c %0a%3c The cards are designed to temporarily hold a small fae spirit within that gives the card powers when activated.
