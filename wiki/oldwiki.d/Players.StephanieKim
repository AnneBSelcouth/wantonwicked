Her nose is straight, lips pert and expression prone to a thoughtful sourness unless something happens to win one of her rare smiles.  She is relatively fair skinned, and her form slender and lithe.  Her dyed brown hair is grown out to her waist with fringe cut just above her eyes. straight nose, dyed brown hair that’s grown out near to her waist and pert lips.  %0a%0a''Mein'': Stephanie’s brown hair becomes a perfect dyed black and her eyes become wider and larger; black irises threatening to swallow up all of the whites of her eyes.  Her fingers and her legs are a shade longer that what strictly might look natural though still slender and shapely.  Gold leaf adorns her skin in this form, down her neck, along the sides of her face, across her shoulders, her torso, down her waist and her legs.  Whatever its true purpose was, now as it catches the light the faint glimmer and shift of light calls attention to the preternatural grace that was stolen from the fae and granted to the Winter Courtier.%0a%0ahttp://wantonwicked.gamingsandbox.com/wiki/images/ctl/headers/ctl_h.png%0aStephanie is notoriously close-lipped, barely liking to admit to her own court much less her own experiences.  Still, there are a few basic facts which she gladly shares if for no other reason than to explain some of the oddities of her behavior.  She grew up in Pyongyang under the kind auspice of Great Leader Kim Il Sung.  While she doesn’t seem to disparage her life growing up in communist North Korea and indeed still feels fondly towards her home country despite the hardships… it is understandable why she would, subsequently, rarely complain about her Durance.  What she is loathed to admit, however, is the fact that Stephanie can no longer easily tell which is which.  Both lives blend into a single strange narrative due to the effects of Faerie and making matters worse is her tendency to back “blend” people who she knows now into points in her history subconsciously without the impossibility of the situation hindering her memories.  For recent events her mind remains as sharp as a tact to the last detail.  But, it seems, for things that happened prior to her Durance something was shuffled about making it harder to keep things straight.%0a%0aOr worse, to make space for something else being placed there.  %0a%0aStill, Stephanie was abducted after the Mass Games celebrating Great Leader’s birthday though she is not sure how old he was turning a few clues lead it to being sometime in the early 1980s.  She remembers men in uniform coming to take her away though she is unclear whether that was in Korea or Faerie.  Her Keeper, [[TheBlackCompany|The Black Company]] was less single entity and more an organization of spies, saboteurs and infiltrators of which she became an agent.  Why the Black Company take a dancer?  What was the Opera House?  Who was the Master of Spies?%0a%0a''What was her final mission?''%0a%0aStephanie arrived into Savannah with [[MarcusAldrich|Marcus Aldrich]]; rolling in on the back of an old Harley Davidson motorcycle.  How they first met, what caused them to flee their first home, and what's occurred along the way has been a relatively well guarded secret.  Still, the observant will note they are rarely outside from each other’s company and they seem to know each other well enough to communicate without words.  While Marcus meets the situation with a decided optimism about their future together in this new home, Steph remains remarkably more guarded and suspicious of this new place. %0a[[%3c%3c]]%0a[[%3c%3c]]%0a%0ahttp://wantonwicked.gamingsandbox.com/wiki/images/ctl/headers/ctl_rph.png%0a%0a%25lfloat text-align=center margin-top=5px margin-right=25px margin-bottom=0px margin-left=0px newwin%25 http://i77.photobucket.com/albums/j52/Kitsuiko/46e507ff-1667-4655-bdb4-5f8180433894_zps3560aeba.jpg%0a%0a* '''Daughter of the Revolution''': (Lost) ''Due to growing up in communist North Korea, Stephanie sees a remarkably high amount of waste and softness with American culture.

Still, there are a few basic facts which she gladly shares if for no other reason than to explain some of the oddities of her behavior.  She grew up in Pyongyang under the kind auspice of Great Leader Kim Il Sung.  While she doesn’t seem to disparage her life growing up in communist North Korea and indeed still feels fondly towards her home country despite the hardships… it is understandable why she would, subsequently, rarely complain about her Durance.
