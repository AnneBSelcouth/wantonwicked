Larger donations will be awarded bonus points over several (applicable) months.--]%0a*[--Donations of $5 or less may not be split between characters.--]%0a%0a''FAQ''%0a%0aQ:Is this a thing?%0aA:Yes, it is. Thank you for asking.%0a%0aQ:When is bXP awarded for being a site supporter?%0aA:The first of each month until your supporter status expires.%0a%0aQ:Is there a cutoff date each month to get money in by?%0aA:I would recommend to get it in a day or two before the end of the month to give me time to process payments. It is still a manual process to update your account at this point. I will be checking payments regularly on the last day of the month, but save yourself some trouble and get it in a bit earlier so you can make sure that your character's are selected.%0a%0aQ:How much bXP do I get at the first of each month?%0aA:You receive the sitewide monthly maximum, which at this moment is 5XP. If the max goes up or down, the supporter max becomes that same amount.%0a%0aQ:Can I get this for both of my sanctioned characters?%0aA:Yes, you can, you just have to pay double. On the contribution page You will see two options, $5 for 1 month or $10 for one month. The $10 option covers two characters.%0a%0aQ:Can I get back XP by paying more?%0aA:No you cannot. Sorry.%0a%0aQ:Can I pay for multiple months at one time?%0aA:Yes. You can. Just update the quantity of your purchase. If you're feeling zesty you can pay for multiple years at a time.%0a%0aQ:How do I tell you which character to give the bXP to?%0aA:Easy, you don't! Just visit the supporter page and click the link to set your characters to receive bXP for supporting the site. When you become a supporter, you will receive an email after you've been added to the site. If you don't see it, make sure to check your spam filter.%0a%0aQ:Wow! That's cool, can I change which character gets bXP?%0aA:Yes, you can. You can switch between your two characters from month to month if you're feeling like it.%0a%0aQ:Can I get bonus XP on my second character if I switched them in the middle of the month?%0aA:No. bXP is only awarded at the first of the month. Sorry.%0a%0aQ:But my character died in the middle of the month.%0aA:Still no.%0a%0aQ:*Sad Panda Face*%0aA: Here, have a cookie. By the time you've finished this FAQ, you'll feel right as rain.%0a%0aQ:Are there any deals to be had?%0aA:You can pay for a full year of support for only $50, which is a savings of $10. Go buy yourself lunch with that $10 in your pocket.%0a%0aQ:Is there a recurring payment option?%0aA:No there isn't. I'm sorry.%0a%0aQ:What does this money go towards?%0aA:The money goes primarily to hosting costs of the server. It's located on a cloud VPS server through SiteGround. They aren't the cheapest, but the benefits and support that they provide have been great and I would recommend them to anyone looking for a reliable hosting provider. Notice how the site is always available. Yeah. I love these guys. :)%0a%0aQ:So there's no cost for the chat software (ProChat Rooms)?%0aA:Nope. We own the software. I've been working to make upgrades and extensions of the software to make it suit our needs. No other site will have a chat quite like Wanton Wicked's. The only costs for the chat will be related to any potential upgrades that may be offered that offer something that the current version doesn't support.%0a%0aQ:Is there going to be Bonus XP for September 2013?%0aA:Yes. After much discussion between the Admin staff. Jeff will be awarding bXP to site supporter characters on Sept 30th. We will work to try to determine the appropriate amount of XP that a character should receive. There may be a couple of miscalculations, but it should be close to right. This is a one-time exception to the 1st of the month rule. This is something of an early bird special.
