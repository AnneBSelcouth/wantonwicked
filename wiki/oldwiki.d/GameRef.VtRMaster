Alabaster columns on its buildings. Long branches overhanging streets and turning sidewalks pale green as light passes through the leaves above... Sculptures and pristine clear fountains. Art unfolds from the landscape like blooming flowers all around in a city which emerged from the fires of destruction and saw only an opportunity to do better.%0a%0aBy night, the city transforms. Trees that once brought peaceful shade now bring dark shadows where hungry predators lurk, licking their fangs. Lovers clasped hand in hand are replaced by flickering images of ghostly partners from bygone eras. The laugh of dancing water is drowned out by the thrumming thumps from the night club beats and distant gunshots from the rougher parts of town.%0a%0aThe Kindred are well used to being the apex predators in any city, but in Savannah their nocturnal rule has been disrupted by an unknown entity which seized their Praxis a year ago, in December of 2012. It claims to be Kindred but none admit to have seen it. All that is known is that this phantom’s words are written in blood upon the walls of Havens and Elysiums without further explanation. Those who defy the words disappear so thoroughly that not even ash remains. It gave itself no name, but the Kindred call it the Revenant Prince.%0a%0aAfter the disappearances of several of their elders, including the Sanctified Prince, the Invictus knelt to this new mysterious Prince and now serve as enforcers of its rule… but they have arranged for a quiet alliance with the Ordo Dracul to whom they set the task of discovering this entity’s true identity and purpose. The Lancea Sanctum previously held the city in their grip, but now have been driven underground and into the arms of the Carthian Movement. Together the Sanctified and the Young Turks push back against the Revenant Prince who they see as usurper and tyrant, but they do so carefully as their numbers and resources thin. The Circle of the Crone lingers distantly, well accustomed to giving tribute to unknown gods and following rules which seem to make no sense. They straddle the line between the other Covenants, keeping them from pushing too hard against each other lest the Acolytes sweep in and snap up fresh tribute while the others are occupied with fighting each other.%0a%0a!!!!Theme: The Inescapable Past%0aNo matter what we do, our pasts inevitably return to haunt us. Small mistakes are amplified over time, and when you are immortal those mistakes can grow to a great size indeed. The streets of Savannah are littered with hungry ghosts, and many of them were born from the actions of the city’s Kindred. Even the rankest neonate is desperately fleeing from their mortal life even as they try to cling to their humanity. In the end, however, no one can escape their past.%0a%0a!!!!Mood: Haunted%0aMemories of the things you've done flicker at the edges of your consciousness like hungry ghosts waiting to consume you. Sometimes you may see things that you hope are not there. Often you feel as if something is watching as you move from one step to the next of your Danse Macabre. Distant music plays off key, and you misstep. Will anyone notice? You know that whatever is watching you did.%0a[[#IntroductionEnd]]%0a%0a!Vampiric Law%0a[[#Law]]%0a[[#P]]%0a!!Proclamations of the Revenant Prince%0a%0a* The Revenant is your Prince%0a*None shall know the Revanant%0a*To imitate your Prince is forbidden%0a*To deny the will of your Prince is forbidden%0a*To break traditions is forbidden%0a*To practice the sanctified mass within Savannah is forbidden%0a*When the Primogen speaks as one, they speak with the Prince's will%0a*The city shall be divided into domains and regents placed over these domains%0a*The regents determine who may feed within their domain%0a*The Sheriff enforces the will of your Prince%0a*What the Seneschal hears the Prince will know.%0a[[#E]]%0a%0a!!The Law of Elijah (Elysium)%0a*No Kindred of mine will be subject to violence or threat in my Elysium.%0a*There will be no weapons drawn nor brandished within my Elysium.%0a*None except myself or my chosen agents may make use of any Discipline in my Elysium.%0a*Tell none not of the Blood where my Elysium lies.

Their leaders began as neonates but are now elder or ancillae themselves, entrenched in the city’s positions. These former agents of change are now the target of rebels themselves as well as opposition from a reinvigorated Invictus seeking to regain what they lost a century ago.%0a%0aAlthough the former Prince was Sanctified, the Carthians filled many of the city’s other positions including Sheriff and two Primogen seats which they still hold in these nights, and the Prefect Edward Corey was the old Prince’s Seneschal. Thus they were responsible for the night to night administration of the city and its laws while the Prince focused on the spiritual health of the city’s Kindred and possessed a seldom-utilized veto power. Under the rule of the Revenant Prince they still maintain much of this function, desperately trying to maintain order in the face of unknown chaos.%0a%0aThe faction currently in power operates under a form of representative democracy, with the Prefect, Myrmidon, and Primogen all being elected positions who represent the Carthian Movement to the Prince and the rest of the city. Inside the Carthian Domains all Kindred who possess status in the covenant are considered full citizens, given a (theoretically) equal share of territory and hunting rights as well as being expected to share temporal power such as mortal allies with their fellow citizens.%0a%0aThe Prefect’s faction is content to maintain these laws within their own domain, but there is a younger faction who believe in a more extreme vision. The Revenant Prince’s rule is seen as an extreme usurpation by these Young Turks, led by Chris Sloane and his coterie of radicals. These Kindred openly desire to usurp the current praxis, and its anyone’s guess why they haven’t disappeared like so many other who have antagonized the Revenant Prince.%0a[[#CC]]%0a%0a!!The Circle of the Crone%0a%25lfloat text-align=center margin-top=5px margin-right=15px margin-bottom=5px margin-left=0px%25http://wantonwicked.gamingsandbox.com/wiki/images/vtr/symbols/vtr_logo_cotc.png%0aThe Circle of the Crone of Savannah dwell on the edges of the city, long content to observe their own rituals and keep their own counsel. The old Prince, Sanctified though he was, tolerated their existence for they had been here before he rose to power. Indeed, their Hierophant, Adair, claims to be among the first European Kindred to settle in the area in the wake of Oglethorpe’s men, who first treated with the few native Kindred and was gifted with their secrets and their legacy.%0a%0aThe primary temple of the Acolytes is simply referred to as “The Orchard”, and it is precisely as the name suggests: a massive tangle of apple and peach trees with their branches carefully tended through the centuries in order to twist them together and form walls of living wood. At the center of this organic labyrinth there grows The Old Oak, a massive tree that is one of the last remaining vestiges of the old growth forest that once flourished across North America.%0a%0aThe native Kindred feared this tree, for it had long been blessed by the spirits and its branches were believed to be as baneful to a vampire as the light of the sun. Meanwhile Adair and her small coterie were adherents of a faction of Acolytes long associated with the druidic practices of the old Celtic peoples, and who held the secrets of special rituals related to trees and the creation of mandragora, or ghouled plants. They carried with them a cutting from a mistletoe mandragora more ancient than any of them, and they planted this in such a way that it would consume and corrupt the old oak to a powerful avatar of the Crone, which figures prominently in their sacred rites to this night.%0a%0aOver time other Acolyte factions came to the area, and their beliefs were absorbed and syncretized into Adair’s cult just as the oak tree and the mistletoe had intertwined. Kindred who give reverence to spirits beyond sight, aristocratic neo-classicists resurrecting Dionysian mysteries, and punk neonates praying to nothing more complicated than the thrill of the hunt all exist among Savannah’s Circle of the Crone tonight. They are united, however, in the central beliefs of their faith and in the ideal that their covenant’s organization should emulate the tree which they worship with blood. All the old ways growing as one and overcoming the trials set to the Kindred.%0a[[#I]]%0a%0a!!The Invictus%0a%0a%25lfloat text-align=center margin-top=5px margin-right=15px margin-bottom=5px margin-left=0px%25http://wantonwicked.gamingsandbox.com/wiki/images/vtr/symbols/vtr_logo_i.png%0aFor more than a century, the Invictus have been waiting. The first Prince of Savannah belonged to their covenant, but his gross incompetence and totalitarianism was deemed repugnant. They stepped aside when the Lancea Sanctum and the Carthian Movement came for him, with the assumption that the other covenants would understand that this was deliberate and that they would be rewarded. They were not.%0a%0aNonetheless the new regime found it difficult to remove the Invictus completely from power, and they were able to maintain the bulk of their territory and temporal control of the mortal herd. They knew that in time the current regime would fall, and they would rise to power once again. The former has come to pass, and the Invictus of Savannah are determined to ensure the latter does as well.%0a%0aThe Revenant Prince has seen fit to restore several of their old territories, and chosen an Invictus as his Seneschal, but that isn’t enough for them. They do not want to punish the Lancea Sanctum, they want to bind them to their role as the Second Estate once more. If they free them from their exile to the Carthian Domains, surely they will finally be grateful for all the Invictus has done for them.%0a%0aThe Invictus operate strongly through patron-client relationships, with elder Kindred being responsible for the the upkeep and grooming of several younger vampires. In their quest for power they will utilize any methodology, but actions which drive potential allies away from the covenant are frowned upon except where they are part of a larger plot. Failure is punished harshly, and success is rewarded grandly.%0a%0aDuring the long reign of the Sanctified Prince the Invictus made close relationships with the Circle of the Crone, but have kept this relationship largely concealed from the city as a whole. Now they begin to weave a web of control and alliances which will reduce the Carthians to rubble, return the Sanctified to their sides, and raise the Invictus up to control of the Praxis once more. The only thorn in their side is uncontrollable factor of the Revenant Prince, and this outlier rankles at them even as it provides the First Estate with the tools they need to enact their will.%0a[[#LS]]%0a%0a!!The Lancea Sanctum%0a%0a%25lfloat text-align=center margin-top=5px margin-right=15px margin-bottom=5px margin-left=0px%25http://wantonwicked.gamingsandbox.com/wiki/images/vtr/symbols/vtr_logo_ls.png%0aFor almost one hundred and fifty years, the Sanctified held the office of Prince in the city of Savannah. The higher offices of the church were occupied by traditionalists of the Monachal Creed while many of the lay duties were held by Tollison Creed evangelists. During their usurpation of The Old Man of Savannah their covenant formed a close relationship with the Carthian Movement, a relationship which continues to this day.%0aOnce they held the praxis they did not abuse their position of dominance in the city, instead seeing a generous and lenient rule (by the standards of the Kindred) to be a form of evangelism designed to entice vampires of other covenants to the church. There were some exceptions to this: attendance of a monthly mass was mandatory, and while the Circle of the Crone were not directly persecuted they were offered no territory nor court positions during this time.%0a%0aIt all ended, of course, in a single night of terror. Many of the Sanctified reported suffering terrible dreams during their daysleep on December 21, 2012. Upon rising, it soon became apparent to the city that many Kindred had very suddenly gone missing, including the Prince, the Cardinal, and all three Monachal Bishops. The Lancea Sanctum very suddenly found itself bereft of central leadership, as the Tollison Creed refused to kowtow to the strict hierarchy of the Monachals.%0a%0aAs the Revenant Prince made its rule known, the old domains previously controlled by the Lancea Sanctum were given to the Invictus and Ordo Dracul. Several more Sanctified rose up and made their denial of this unknown ruler publically known… they soon joined the other Kindred who had disappeared. Any open rebellion was quickly squashed as without any Regents the remaining Sancitified were forced to seek havens and feedings grounds in domains controlled by other covenants, primarily their old allies The Carthian Movement. To add insult to injury, the performance of Sanctified mass was banned within the city limits.%0a%0aThe Lancea Sanctum of tonight is broken, but not beaten. They risk lupines and the wrath of the sun to attend mass in rural farmhouses. In secret they pass sacred scrolls containing the secrets of their holy works and the Testament of Longinus from Kindred to Kindred. And most of all they wait for the mystery of the Revenant Prince to be unravelled, for they know that nothing is eternal but the will of God.%0a[[#OD]]%0a%0a!!The Ordo Dracul%0a%0a%25lfloat text-align=center margin-top=5px margin-right=15px margin-bottom=5px margin-left=0px%25http://wantonwicked.gamingsandbox.com/wiki/images/vtr/symbols/vtr_logo_od.png%0aIn Savannah, the Ordo Dracul are dominated by the Philadelphian Rite, an inclusive and relatively open version of the typically secretive covenant. They do not deny their existence and participate directly in the politics of the city, including having a Primogen which belongs to their order. The Academy was founded in the early twentieth century by the former Invictus, Esteban Cypriano, and several other Kindred. It has always been a rather small chapterhouse, but they have applied what resources they possess with impressive efficiency.%0a%0aMostly the Ordo Dracul see the rest of the city’s Kindred as rats in a maze, little more than experiments to be observed carefully. Every now and again they nudge events to keep things moving, but the former “benevolent” praxis of the Sanctified made any attempts at encouraging change difficult at best. The rise of the Revenant Prince has left them in a dangerous situation; many other Kindred suspect that they are responsible for the change in praxis. Nonetheless Cypriano and his brethren claim they are as unaware of the new Prince’s identity as anyone else.%0a%0aIt is suspicious, however, that every covenant’s position in the city seems to be suddenly undergoing great change except for the Dragons. They have unprecedented freedom to pursue their transcendent studies, but will the price be too high? And will the mystery of the Revenant Prince prove too tempting a fruit to pluck?%0a[[#CovenantsEnd]]%0a%0a!Character Creation%0a[[#CharacterCreation]]%0a!!Vitals and Information%0a!!!Age%0a* '''Years embraced >30 years ago %25red%25(2)%25%25'''%0a!!!Malkavia%0a* '''Being infected by Malkavia %25red%25(2)%25%25''' ''Note: Malkavia is known in Savannah and was previously punishable by Final Death.

Once we've decided on the crunch your character can begin developing it. A custom Devotion requires a number of justifications equal to the highest level Discipline in its construction. A custom Blood Sorcery requires a number of justifications equal to its level. You can make one justification post a month. These justifications will often but not always require accompanying rolls.%0a%0aUnless the PC teaches it to others, that custom power will only be available to the PC which develops it, and its mechanics will not be posted publicly.%0a%0aA justification is a significant piece of your characters story that displays work towards, use of, or improvement of the item requested. Examples include: Scenes with storytellers, logs of scenes with players, bluebooking, teaching from an appropriate mentor and potentially other unthought-of methods created by players and approved by storytellers.%0a%0aSTs will sometimes waive some or all of the justification requirements. This usually involves some kind of supernatural intervention (like goblin markets), material acquisitions (in the case of items/havens/retainers etc), or extraordinary circumstances.%0a%0a[[#PT]]%0a!!The Predator’s Taint%0aPredator’s Taint only affects vampires in extreme situations where the Kindred is ambushed or under a great deal of pressure. It does not need to be rolled or roleplayed except when players feel it is appropriate or a ST calls for it.%0a%0a[[#ABP]]%0a!!Average Blood Pool%0aThe Average Blood Pool system attempts to provide a mechanical use for merits like Haven Location and Herd, which on a chat setting tend to go unused due to the nature of the chat-format. The system aims to make blood matter, and gives a strong incentive for players to try and work towards better feeding grounds and access to bigger herds. A number of factors influence your ABP, most of which can change during play based on how well your character is doing politically or socially, or through the acquisition of new merits.%0a%0a!!!The System%0aYour ABP (Average Blood Pool) represents the total amount of vitae you can spend in a single night. This is the number you start each night with, and already has the vitae spent for waking up subtracted from it. Note that this amount does not refill after a scene; if you spend 3 vitae in a scene, and your ABP is 7, you will have 4 vitae in the next scene if that scene is set on the same night.%0a%0aEach vampire has a basic starting pool of 4 Vitae. Various modifiers are applied to this, the most important being the Haven Location rating of the domain (if any) the vampire has dwells in. Simply put, the formula is:%0a%0a4 Base Vitae + Herd + Haven Location +/- additional modifiers.%0a%0aIn the case of having multiple Havens, only the highest rating applies; after all, you're only sleeping in one of them at a time.%0a%0a!!!Possible positive modifiers%0a*Havens in additional domains - Each additional domain that a character has a Haven in adds +1 to their ABP. (this applies even to domains with a Location rating of 0)%0a*Feeds on animals in addition to humans - Feeding on animals in addition to a regular Kindred 'diet' provides another +1 to the ABP. This does bring certain risks with it however, and is not necessarily socially acceptable in all circles of Kindred.%0a*Receiving blood rent from vassals or tenants - By giving up dots of their own ABP, a character can pay 'blood rent' to the character that owns the domain they have been granted feeding rights in. These dots are added to the Lord's ABP.%0a*Coil of Blood - Dragons with the first tier of the Coil of Blood gain a +1 to their ABP at resolve 2, +2 at resolve 3, +3 at resolve 4, and +4 at resolve 5. Dragons with the third tier of the Coil of Blood gain +1 to their ABP. This is in addition to the bonus they receive from the first tier. In addition, successes on hunting rolls count twice.%0a%0a!!!Possible negative modifiers%0a*Feeding exclusively on animals - incurs a -1 penalty to your ABP%0a*Protean 2 - Using earthmeld (or a variation) as the primary means of providing a place to sleep during the day incurs a -1 penalty to ABP.%0a*Ghouls - A ghoul normally does not incur a penalty, however, that means the Ghoul only receives enough Vitae to sustain themselves, and can not use Vitae to fuel disciplines or healing. A well fed ghoul incurs a -1 penalty, but may use vitae as normal.%0a*Poaching - Poaching adds another +1 to ABP if the character is being careful, or +3 if the character is being careless. When poaching, notify the Storytellers via the request system and state which domain your character is poaching in. Note that poaching is dangerous and can potentially lead to character death if caught. Note that poaching only adds to your ABP if it is in *addition* to regular feeding in a domain. Vampires without Havens are already considered to be poaching, but don't get this bonus.%0a*Bloodlines, Banes & Derangements - Certain bloodlines as well as certain certain banes and derangements can also affect a person's blood levels, this should be worked out on a case by case basis with your ST.%0a%0a!!!Example%0aVarney the Vampire has just moved into town. For a while, he avoids the court, and has no Haven in any domain. He has a base vitae pool of 4, but because he also feeds on rats, gets +1 to his pool, for a total of 5.%0a%0aA few weeks later, after he has successfully convinced the Court to let him stay he petitions Vampire Bob for feeding rights. Vampire Bob owns a small domain with a Domain Location rating of 2. He agrees to let Varney make a Haven there in exchange for a small amount of blood rent amounting to 1 Vitae a night. As a result, Varney's base pool of 4 is added to not just by the +1 from the rats he continues to feed on, but also by the +2 of the Location he has a Haven in. However, because he is now paying a small amount of bloodrent to Vampire Bob, -1 is deducted from his total pool. He is left with an ABP of 6.%0a%0aSeveral years later, after Varney has joined the Ordo Dracul, he learns the first tier of the Coil of Blood. Varney has a resolve of 3, and so gains another +2 to his pool, for a total of 8. When he then acquires a ghoul which he keeps well fed so he may serve as a bodyguard, that pool is then once again reduced by -2 to 6, but because he's acquired Havens in 3 additional domains, he gets +3 for a total of 9. On top of that, he has acquired a small herd, worth 2 dots, so his ABP increases to 11. Varney has a blood potency of 1, so can only hold 10 vitae at a time, but if he spends any amount of Vitae in a scene, he may refill his pool using the 1 remaining dot before the next scene.%0a%0a[Much of this ABP system was adapted from http://www.nokturnis.net with permission of its owner]%0a[[#H]]%0a%0a!!Haven: Location%0aA Haven's location will be determined by the District that it is located in.

They do not require certain Disciplines nor Blood Potency to purchase, though their experience costs remain unchanged.

It does not need to be rolled or roleplayed except when players feel it is appropriate or a ST calls for it.%0a%3c %0a%3c !!Average Blood Pool%0a%3c The Average Blood Pool system attempts to provide a mechanical use for merits like Haven Location and Herd, which on a chat setting tend to go unused due to the nature of the chat-format. The system aims to make blood matter, and gives a strong incentive for players to try and work towards better feeding grounds and access to bigger herds. A number of factors influence your ABP, most of which can change during play based on how well your character is doing politically or socially, or through the acquisition of new merits.%0a%3c %0a%3c !!!The System%0a%3c Your ABP (Average Blood Pool) represents the total amount of vitae you can spend in a single night. This is the number you start each night with, and already has the vitae spent for waking up subtracted from it. Note that this amount does not refill after a scene; if you spend 3 vitae in a scene, and your ABP is 7, you will have 4 vitae in the next scene if that scene is set on the same night.%0a%3c %0a%3c Each vampire has a basic starting pool of 4 Vitae. Various modifiers are applied to this, the most important being the Haven Location rating of the domain (if any) the vampire has dwells in. Simply put, the formula is:%0a%3c %0a%3c 4 Base Vitae + Herd + Haven Location +/- additional modifiers.%0a%3c %0a%3c In the case of having multiple Havens, only the highest rating applies; after all, you're only sleeping in one of them at a time.%0a%3c %0a%3c !!!Possible positive modifiers%0a%3c Havens in additional domains - Each additional domain that a character has a Haven in adds +1 to their ABP. (this applies even to domains with a Location rating of 0)%0a%3c Feeds on animals in addition to humans - Feeding on animals in addition to a regular Kindred 'diet' provides another +1 to the ABP. This does bring certain risks with it however, and is not necessarily socially acceptable in all circles of Kindred.%0a%3c Receiving blood rent from vassals or tenants - By giving up dots of their own ABP, a character can pay 'blood rent' to the character that owns the domain they have been granted feeding rights in. These dots are added to the Lord's ABP.%0a%3c Coil of Blood - Dragons with the first tier of the Coil of Blood gain a +1 to their ABP at resolve 2, +2 at resolve 3, +3 at resolve 4, and +4 at resolve 5. Dragons with the third tier of the Coil of Blood gain +1 to their ABP. This is in addition to the bonus they receive from the first tier. In addition, successes on hunting rolls count twice.%0a%3c %0a%3c %0a%3c !!!Possible negative modifiers%0a%3c Feeding exclusively on animals - incurs a -1 penalty to your ABP%0a%3c Protean 2 - Using earthmeld (or a variation) as the primary means of providing a place to sleep during the day incurs a -1 penalty to ABP.%0a%3c Ghouls - A ghoul normally does not incur a penalty, however, that means the Ghoul only receives enough Vitae to sustain themselves, and can not use Vitae to fuel disciplines or healing. A well fed ghoul incurs a -1 penalty, but may use vitae as normal.%0a%3c Poaching - Poaching adds another +1 to ABP if the character is being careful, or +3 if the character is being careless. When poaching, notify the Storytellers via the request system and state which domain your character is poaching in. Note that poaching is dangerous and can potentially lead to character death if caught. Note that poaching only adds to your ABP if it is in *addition* to regular feeding in a domain. Vampires without Havens are already considered to be poaching, but don't get this bonus.%0a%3c Bloodlines, Banes & Derangements - Certain bloodlines as well as certain certain banes and derangements can also affect a person's blood levels, this should be worked out on a case by case basis with your ST.%0a%3c %0a%3c %0a%3c !!!Example%0a%3c Varney the Vampire has just moved into town. For a while, he avoids the court, and has no Haven in any domain. He has a base vitae pool of 4, but because he also feeds on rats, gets +1 to his pool, for a total of 5.%0a%3c %0a%3c A few weeks later, after he has successfully convinced the Court to let him stay he petitions Vampire Bob for feeding rights. Vampire Bob owns a small domain with a Domain Location rating of 2. He agrees to let Varney make a Haven there in exchange for a small amount of blood rent amounting to 1 Vitae a night. As a result, Varney's base pool of 4 is added to not just by the +1 from the rats he continues to feed on, but also by the +2 of the Location he has a Haven in. However, because he is now paying a small amount of bloodrent to Vampire Bob, -1 is deducted from his total pool. He is left with an ABP of 6.%0a%3c %0a%3c Several years later, after Varney has joined the Ordo Dracul, he learns the first tier of the Coil of Blood. Varney has a resolve of 3, and so gains another +2 to his pool, for a total of 8. When he then acquires a ghoul which he keeps well fed so he may serve as a bodyguard, that pool is then once again reduced by -2 to 6, but because he's acquired Havens in 3 additional domains, he gets +3 for a total of 9. On top of that, he has acquired a small herd, worth 2 dots, so his ABP increases to 11. Varney has a blood potency of 1, so can only hold 10 vitae at a time, but if he spends any amount of Vitae in a scene, he may refill his pool using the 1 remaining dot before the next scene.%0a%3c %0a%3c [Much of this ABP system was adapted from http://www.nokturnis.net with permission of its owner]%0a%3c [[#HouseRulesEnd]]%0a\ No newline at end of file%0a---%0a> [[#CharacterCreationEnd]]%0a\ No newline at end of file%0a

Alabaster columns on its buildings. Long branches overhanging streets and turning sidewalks pale green as light passes through the leaves above... Sculptures and pristine clear fountains. Art unfolds from the landscape like blooming flowers all around in a city which emerged from the fires of destruction and saw only an opportunity to do better.%0a%3c %0a%3c By night, the city transforms. Trees that once brought peaceful shade now bring dark shadows where hungry predators lurk, licking their fangs. Lovers clasped hand in hand are replaced by flickering images of ghostly partners from bygone eras. The laugh of dancing water is drowned out by the thrumming thumps from the night club beats and distant gunshots from the rougher parts of town.%0a%3c %0a%3c The Kindred are well used to being the apex predators in any city, but in Savannah their nocturnal rule has been disrupted by an unknown entity which seized their Praxis a year ago, in December of 2012. It claims to be Kindred but none admit to have seen it. All that is known is that this phantom’s words are written in blood upon the walls of Havens and Elysiums without further explanation. Those who defy the words disappear so thoroughly that not even ash remains. It gave itself no name, but the Kindred call it the Revenant Prince.%0a%3c %0a%3c After the disappearances of several of their elders, including the Sanctified Prince, the Invictus knelt to this new mysterious Prince and now serve as enforcers of its rule… but they have arranged for a quiet alliance with the Ordo Dracul to whom they set the task of discovering this entity’s true identity and purpose. The Lancea Sanctum previously held the city in their grip, but now have been driven underground and into the arms of the Carthian Movement. Together the Sanctified and the Young Turks push back against the Revenant Prince who they see as usurper and tyrant, but they do so carefully as their numbers and resources thin. The Circle of the Crone lingers distantly, well accustomed to giving tribute to unknown gods and following rules which seem to make no sense. They straddle the line between the other Covenants, keeping them from pushing too hard against each other lest the Acolytes sweep in and snap up fresh tribute while the others are occupied with fighting each other.%0a%3c %0a%3c !!!!Theme: The Inescapable Past%0a%3c No matter what we do, our pasts inevitably return to haunt us. Small mistakes are amplified over time, and when you are immortal those mistakes can grow to a great size indeed. The streets of Savannah are littered with hungry ghosts, and many of them were born from the actions of the city’s Kindred. Even the rankest neonate is desperately fleeing from their mortal life even as they try to cling to their humanity. In the end, however, no one can escape their past.%0a%3c %0a%3c !!!!Mood: Haunted%0a%3c Memories of the things you've done flicker at the edges of your consciousness like hungry ghosts waiting to consume you. Sometimes you may see things that you hope are not there. Often you feel as if something is watching as you move from one step to the next of your Danse Macabre. Distant music plays off key, and you misstep. Will anyone notice? You know that whatever is watching you did.%0a%3c [[#IntroductionEnd]]%0a%3c %0a

Their leaders began as neonates but are now elder or ancillae themselves, entrenched in the city’s positions. These former agents of change are now the target of rebels themselves as well as opposition from a reinvigorated Invictus seeking to regain what they lost a century ago.%0a%3c %0a%3c Although the former Prince was Sanctified, the Carthians filled many of the city’s other positions including Sheriff and two Primogen seats which they still hold in these nights, and the Prefect Edward Corey was the old Prince’s Seneschal. Thus they were responsible for the night to night administration of the city and its laws while the Prince focused on the spiritual health of the city’s Kindred and possessed a seldom-utilized veto power. Under the rule of the Revenant Prince they still maintain much of this function, desperately trying to maintain order in the face of unknown chaos.%0a%3c %0a%3c The faction currently in power operates under a form of representative democracy, with the Prefect, Myrmidon, and Primogen all being elected positions who represent the Carthian Movement to the Prince and the rest of the city. Inside the Carthian Domains all Kindred who possess status in the covenant are considered full citizens, given a (theoretically) equal share of territory and hunting rights as well as being expected to share temporal power such as mortal allies with their fellow citizens.%0a%3c %0a%3c The Prefect’s faction is content to maintain these laws within their own domain, but there is a younger faction who believe in a more extreme vision. The Revenant Prince’s rule is seen as an extreme usurpation by these Young Turks, led by Chris Sloane and his coterie of radicals. These Kindred openly desire to usurp the current praxis, and its anyone’s guess why they haven’t disappeared like so many other who have antagonized the Revenant Prince.%0a%3c [[#CC]]%0a%3c %0a%3c !!The Circle of the Crone%0a%3c %25lfloat text-align=center margin-top=5px margin-right=15px margin-bottom=5px margin-left=0px%25http://wantonwicked.gamingsandbox.com/wiki/images/vtr/symbols/vtr_logo_cotc.png%0a%3c The Circle of the Crone of Savannah dwell on the edges of the city, long content to observe their own rituals and keep their own counsel. The old Prince, Sanctified though he was, tolerated their existence for they had been here before he rose to power. Indeed, their Hierophant, Adair, claims to be among the first European Kindred to settle in the area in the wake of Oglethorpe’s men, who first treated with the few native Kindred and was gifted with their secrets and their legacy.%0a%3c %0a%3c The primary temple of the Acolytes is simply referred to as “The Orchard”, and it is precisely as the name suggests: a massive tangle of apple and peach trees with their branches carefully tended through the centuries in order to twist them together and form walls of living wood. At the center of this organic labyrinth there grows The Old Oak, a massive tree that is one of the last remaining vestiges of the old growth forest that once flourished across North America.%0a%3c %0a%3c The native Kindred feared this tree, for it had long been blessed by the spirits and its branches were believed to be as baneful to a vampire as the light of the sun. Meanwhile Adair and her small coterie were adherents of a faction of Acolytes long associated with the druidic practices of the old Celtic peoples, and who held the secrets of special rituals related to trees and the creation of mandragora, or ghouled plants. They carried with them a cutting from a mistletoe mandragora more ancient than any of them, and they planted this in such a way that it would consume and corrupt the old oak to a powerful avatar of the Crone, which figures prominently in their sacred rites to this night.%0a%3c %0a%3c Over time other Acolyte factions came to the area, and their beliefs were absorbed and syncretized into Adair’s cult just as the oak tree and the mistletoe had intertwined. Kindred who give reverence to spirits beyond sight, aristocratic neo-classicists resurrecting Dionysian mysteries, and punk neonates praying to nothing more complicated than the thrill of the hunt all exist among Savannah’s Circle of the Crone tonight. They are united, however, in the central beliefs of their faith and in the ideal that their covenant’s organization should emulate the tree which they worship with blood. All the old ways growing as one and overcoming the trials set to the Kindred.%0a%3c [[#I]]%0a%3c %0a%3c !!The Invictus%0a%3c %0a%3c %25lfloat text-align=center margin-top=5px margin-right=15px margin-bottom=5px margin-left=0px%25http://wantonwicked.gamingsandbox.com/wiki/images/vtr/symbols/vtr_logo_i.png%0a%3c For more than a century, the Invictus have been waiting. The first Prince of Savannah belonged to their covenant, but his gross incompetence and totalitarianism was deemed repugnant. They stepped aside when the Lancea Sanctum and the Carthian Movement came for him, with the assumption that the other covenants would understand that this was deliberate and that they would be rewarded. They were not.%0a%3c %0a%3c Nonetheless the new regime found it difficult to remove the Invictus completely from power, and they were able to maintain the bulk of their territory and temporal control of the mortal herd. They knew that in time the current regime would fall, and they would rise to power once again. The former has come to pass, and the Invictus of Savannah are determined to ensure the latter does as well.%0a%3c %0a%3c The Revenant Prince has seen fit to restore several of their old territories, and chosen an Invictus as his Seneschal, but that isn’t enough for them. They do not want to punish the Lancea Sanctum, they want to bind them to their role as the Second Estate once more. If they free them from their exile to the Carthian Domains, surely they will finally be grateful for all the Invictus has done for them.%0a%3c %0a%3c The Invictus operate strongly through patron-client relationships, with elder Kindred being responsible for the the upkeep and grooming of several younger vampires. In their quest for power they will utilize any methodology, but actions which drive potential allies away from the covenant are frowned upon except where they are part of a larger plot. Failure is punished harshly, and success is rewarded grandly.%0a%3c %0a%3c During the long reign of the Sanctified Prince the Invictus made close relationships with the Circle of the Crone, but have kept this relationship largely concealed from the city as a whole. Now they begin to weave a web of control and alliances which will reduce the Carthians to rubble, return the Sanctified to their sides, and raise the Invictus up to control of the Praxis once more. The only thorn in their side is uncontrollable factor of the Revenant Prince, and this outlier rankles at them even as it provides the First Estate with the tools they need to enact their will.%0a%3c [[#LS]]%0a%3c %0a%3c !!The Lancea Sanctum%0a%3c %0a%3c %25lfloat text-align=center margin-top=5px margin-right=15px margin-bottom=5px margin-left=0px%25http://wantonwicked.gamingsandbox.com/wiki/images/vtr/symbols/vtr_logo_ls.png%0a%3c For almost one hundred and fifty years, the Sanctified held the office of Prince in the city of Savannah. The higher offices of the church were occupied by traditionalists of the Monachal Creed while many of the lay duties were held by Tollison Creed evangelists. During their usurpation of The Old Man of Savannah their covenant formed a close relationship with the Carthian Movement, a relationship which continues to this day.%0a%3c Once they held the praxis they did not abuse their position of dominance in the city, instead seeing a generous and lenient rule (by the standards of the Kindred) to be a form of evangelism designed to entice vampires of other covenants to the church. There were some exceptions to this: attendance of a monthly mass was mandatory, and while the Circle of the Crone were not directly persecuted they were offered no territory nor court positions during this time.%0a%3c %0a%3c It all ended, of course, in a single night of terror. Many of the Sanctified reported suffering terrible dreams during their daysleep on December 21, 2012. Upon rising, it soon became apparent to the city that many Kindred had very suddenly gone missing, including the Prince, the Cardinal, and all three Monachal Bishops. The Lancea Sanctum very suddenly found itself bereft of central leadership, as the Tollison Creed refused to kowtow to the strict hierarchy of the Monachals.%0a%3c %0a%3c As the Revenant Prince made its rule known, the old domains previously controlled by the Lancea Sanctum were given to the Invictus and Ordo Dracul. Several more Sanctified rose up and made their denial of this unknown ruler publically known… they soon joined the other Kindred who had disappeared. Any open rebellion was quickly squashed as without any Regents the remaining Sancitified were forced to seek havens and feedings grounds in domains controlled by other covenants, primarily their old allies The Carthian Movement. To add insult to injury, the performance of Sanctified mass was banned within the city limits.%0a%3c %0a%3c The Lancea Sanctum of tonight is broken, but not beaten. They risk lupines and the wrath of the sun to attend mass in rural farmhouses. In secret they pass sacred scrolls containing the secrets of their holy works and the Testament of Longinus from Kindred to Kindred. And most of all they wait for the mystery of the Revenant Prince to be unravelled, for they know that nothing is eternal but the will of God.%0a%3c [[#OD]]%0a%3c %0a%3c !!The Ordo Dracul%0a%3c %0a%3c %25lfloat text-align=center margin-top=5px margin-right=15px margin-bottom=5px margin-left=0px%25http://wantonwicked.gamingsandbox.com/wiki/images/vtr/symbols/vtr_logo_od.png%0a%3c In Savannah, the Ordo Dracul are dominated by the Philadelphian Rite, an inclusive and relatively open version of the typically secretive covenant. They do not deny their existence and participate directly in the politics of the city, including having a Primogen which belongs to their order. The Academy was founded in the early twentieth century by the former Invictus, Esteban Cypriano, and several other Kindred. It has always been a rather small chapterhouse, but they have applied what resources they possess with impressive efficiency.%0a%3c %0a%3c Mostly the Ordo Dracul see the rest of the city’s Kindred as rats in a maze, little more than experiments to be observed carefully. Every now and again they nudge events to keep things moving, but the former “benevolent” praxis of the Sanctified made any attempts at encouraging change difficult at best. The rise of the Revenant Prince has left them in a dangerous situation; many other Kindred suspect that they are responsible for the change in praxis. Nonetheless Cypriano and his brethren claim they are as unaware of the new Prince’s identity as anyone else.%0a%3c %0a%3c It is suspicious, however, that every covenant’s position in the city seems to be suddenly undergoing great change except for the Dragons. They have unprecedented freedom to pursue their transcendent studies, but will the price be too high? And will the mystery of the Revenant Prince prove too tempting a fruit to pluck?%0a%3c [[#CovenantsEnd]]%0a\ No newline at end of file%0a---%0a> (:table:)%0a\ No newline at end of file%0a
