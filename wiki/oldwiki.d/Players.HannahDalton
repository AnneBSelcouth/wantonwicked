Yet she's not known for playing up her natural good looks the way most of her blood would; she rarely dresses to impress, even when out hunting for easy prey. Most of the time she either wears simple modern attire that's neither too conservative nor too revealing in nature, or she instead sports the kind of look that'll earn her fewer questions asked in the rougher parts of town.%0a%0a%25color=#9c9c9c%25There are some hints of an Asian heritage in her features, though they're easy to miss and mixed in with enough other Eurasian features that the final result means she has a look of exotic beauty to her without necessarily looking out of place anywhere. If anything, its the remnants of a Philly accent that sets her apart.%0a%0a%25lfloat text-align=center margin-top=5px margin-right=15px margin-bottom=5px margin-left=0px%25http://nokturnis.net/graphics/wanton/spacer4.jpg%0a%25color=#9c9c9c%25Given her usual choice of attire combined with her short messy brown hair, she appears to be something of a tomboy, with her general demeanor usually solidifying the fact. Often smug, almost always sarcastic, and frequently an asshole, she can be a difficult person to like. Her personality means that most of her interactions with others are purely of the business variety, but those insightful few with a more discerning and empathetic eye might be able to tell that it's all an act; she's still just a neonate playing at being a monster.%0a[[%3c%3c]]%0ahttp://nokturnis.net/graphics/wanton/spacer2.jpg%0a%25lfloat text-align=center margin-top=5px margin-right=15px margin-bottom=5px margin-left=0px%25http://nokturnis.net/graphics/wanton/spacer3.jpg%0a%25rfloat text-align=center margin-top=5px margin-right=0px margin-bottom=5px margin-left=15px%25http://nokturnis.net/graphics/wanton/spacer3.jpg%0a%25%25http://nokturnis.net/graphics/wanton/personalhistory.jpg%0a%25color=#9c9c9c%25 Hannah arrived in Savannah during the summer of '98 as a young Carthian nomad who came down from further north. Like many such arrivals, she was running from someone or something, but the demands of the Danse Macabre meant that few Kindred held any long-lasting interest in the secrets of a young Carthian who hadn't yet managed to make much of a name for herself. Settling into a south-side tenancy under the prefect, Hannah's been keeping a largely low profile.%0a%0a%25color=#9c9c9c%25 To the Carthians, she's always been known as someone who plays the part and is willing to do whatever the movement requires of her. In fact, some might say she's perhaps a bit *too* willing when it comes to the 'whatever' part; while she isn't quite as extreme as Sloan and his ilk, she doesn't seem to believe much in the prospect of slow change either. Those of the Sanctified who know of her don't perhaps know what to make of her; she's stated that their whole spiel about the purpose of the damned is no doubt correct, but she's also avoided the church and its rituals as much as possible. She clearly has no love for the Circle, so what gives? And as for the others? The Dragons and Invictus? She's just been another neonate Carthian to them, probably. Though in that respect, certainly one of the more annoying ones.%0a(:cellnr colspan=3 width=380 bgcolor=#000 align=center:)%0a%25%25http://nokturnis.net/graphics/wanton/charside4.jpg%0a[[%3c%3c]]%0a(:cellnr colspan=3 width=380 bgcolor=#000 align=left:)%0a%25lfloat text-align=center margin-top=5px margin-right=15px margin-bottom=5px margin-left=0px%25http://nokturnis.net/graphics/wanton/spacer4.jpg%0a%25rfloat text-align=center margin-top=5px margin-right=0px margin-bottom=5px margin-left=15px%25http://nokturnis.net/graphics/wanton/spacer4.jpg%0a%25color=#9c9c9c%25 When the Revenant Prince took control of the city, nothing much changed for Hannah; the Carthian Movement wasn't hit too much at first, and she herself had no role of significance to play in the whole affair. As far as she was concerned, it was just business as usual. Still, people have been chafing against the new leadership, and Hannah's overall involvement with the larger Kindred body has been slowly but subtly changing with it.%0a%0a%25color=#9c9c9c%25If your character has been in Savannah for a while; it's safe to assume that they've met Hannah at least once or twice; perhaps they've even interacted in a more in-depth manner in the past. Feel free to give me an FPM with ideas as to what those interactions might've been.%0a[[%3c%3c]]%0a%0a(:cellnr colspan=3 width=380 bgcolor=#000 align=right:)%0a%25%25http://nokturnis.net/graphics/wanton/storyhooks.jpg%0a(:cellnr colspan=3 width=380 bgcolor=#000 align=left:)%0a%25lfloat text-align=center margin-top=5px margin-right=15px margin-bottom=5px margin-left=0px%25http://nokturnis.net/graphics/wanton/spacer3.jpg%0a%25rfloat text-align=center margin-top=5px margin-right=0px margin-bottom=5px margin-left=15px%25http://nokturnis.net/graphics/wanton/spacer3.jpg%0a%25color=#9c9c9c%25 '''Past Sightings (Mortal & Supernatural):''' %25color=#9c9c9c%25 ''Hannah lived and died in Philedelphia; if your character was there during the late 80's or early 90's, it's entirely possible that you met her. And if you were a vampire in Philadelphia between 1990 and 1995, chances are you've either heard of her, or the events that coincided with her disappearance. After 1995, she's spent some time in Baltimore and Washington D.C, a hell of a lot less savvy than she is tonight, before slowly making her way down the east coast to Savannah, stopping for a while in places along the way. Perhaps you met her out on the road?''%0a%0a%25color=#9c9c9c%25 '''Mystery Past (Supernatural):''' %25color=#9c9c9c%25 ''Who or what was she running from when she came into town, back in 1998? Why does she say she believes the Sanctified are right about the purpose of the Kindred, but keeps her distance from them? Why hasn't she made much of an effort to get ahead in Kindred society until just recently? There are probably answers to these questions; though finding them might not exactly endear you to her.''%0a%0a%25color=#9c9c9c%25 '''A Carthian contact (Supernatural):''' %25color=#9c9c9c%25 ''Carthians have an obvious in with her, but those of other covenants might find that she's easier to turn into a contact than other Carthians. Sure, her personality isn't of the sparkling variety, but at least she doesn't constantly quote political theory at you. Anyone who cares to touch base with a Carthian about anything at all might find that she's at least somewhat receptive as long as you manage to leave God and Politics at the door.''%0a%0a%25lfloat text-align=center margin-top=5px margin-right=15px margin-bottom=5px margin-left=0px%25http://nokturnis.net/graphics/wanton/spacer4.jpg%0a%25rfloat text-align=center margin-top=5px margin-right=0px margin-bottom=5px margin-left=15px%25http://nokturnis.net/graphics/wanton/spacer4.jpg%0a%25color=#9c9c9c%25 '''Face Around Town (Mortal):''' %25color=#9c9c9c%25 ''Though nobody knows whether or not she actually 'does' anything, she's a regular appearance in circles that law-abiding citizens tend to avoid.

Yet she's not known for playing up her natural good looks the way most of her blood would; she rarely dresses to impress, even when out hunting for easy prey. Most of the time she either wears simple modern attire that's neither too conservative nor too revealing in nature, or she instead sports the kind of look that'll earn her fewer questions asked in the rougher parts of town.%0a%3c %0a%3c %25color=#9c9c9c%25There are some hints of an Asian heritage in her features, though they're easy to miss and mixed in with enough other Eurasian features that the final result means she has a look of exotic beauty to her without necessarily looking out of place anywhere. If anything, its the remnants of a Philly accent that sets her apart.%0a%3c %0a%3c %25lfloat text-align=center margin-top=5px margin-right=15px margin-bottom=5px margin-left=0px%25http://nokturnis.net/graphics/wanton/spacer4.jpg%0a%3c %25color=#9c9c9c%25Given her usual choice of attire combined with her short messy black, she appears to be something of a tomboy, with her general demeanor usually solidifying the fact. Often smug, almost always sarcastic, and frequently an asshole, she can be a difficult person to like. Her personality means that most of her interactions with others are purely of the business variety, but those insightful few with a more discerning and empathetic eye might be able to tell that it's all an act; she's still just a neonate playing at being a monster.%0a%3c [[%3c%3c]]%0a%3c http://nokturnis.net/graphics/wanton/spacer2.jpg%0a%3c %25lfloat text-align=center margin-top=5px margin-right=15px margin-bottom=5px margin-left=0px%25http://nokturnis.net/graphics/wanton/spacer3.jpg%0a%3c %25%25http://nokturnis.net/graphics/wanton/personalhistory.jpg%0a%3c %25color=#9c9c9c%25 Hannah arrived in Savannah during the summer of '98 as a young Carthian nomad who came down from further north. Like many such arrivals, she was running from someone or something, but the demands of the Danse Macabre meant that few Kindred held any long-lasting interest in the secrets of a young Carthian who hadn't yet managed to make much of a name for herself. Settling into a south-side tenancy under the prefect, Hannah's been keeping a largely low profile.%0a%3c %0a%3c %25color=#9c9c9c%25 To the Carthians, she's always been known as someone who plays the part and is willing to do whatever the movement requires of her. In fact, some might say she's perhaps a bit *too* willing when it comes to the 'whatever' part; while she isn't quite as extreme as Sloan and his ilk, she doesn't seem to believe much in the prospect of slow change either. Those of the Sanctified who know of her don't perhaps know what to make of her; she's stated that their whole spiel about the purpose of the damned is no doubt correct, but she's also avoided the church and its rituals as much as possible. She clearly has no love for the Circle, so what gives? And as for the others? The Dragons and Invictus? She's just been another neonate Carthian to them, probably. Though in that respect, certainly one of the more annoying ones.%0a%3c (:cellnr colspan=3 width=380 bgcolor=#000 align=center:)%0a%3c %25%25http://nokturnis.net/graphics/wanton/charmiddle.jpg%0a%3c [[%3c%3c]]%0a%3c (:cellnr colspan=3 width=380 bgcolor=#000 align=left:)%0a%3c %25lfloat text-align=center margin-top=5px margin-right=15px margin-bottom=5px margin-left=0px%25http://nokturnis.net/graphics/wanton/spacer4.jpg%0a%3c %25color=#9c9c9c%25 When the Revenant Prince took control of the city, nothing much changed for Hannah; the Carthian Movement wasn't hit too much at first, and she herself had no role of significance to play in the whole affair.
