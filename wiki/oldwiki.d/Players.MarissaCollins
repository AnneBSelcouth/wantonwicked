After her escape, she shied away from the changeling community as a whole, choosing to distance herself from everything related to Arcadia. It took several months before she realized that she was unable to return to her former human life, that she is as much part changeling as she is human, and that she in fact needs the help of the other Lost. Since then, she has integrated herself more with the Freehold community and have managed to find a tenuous balance between her fae and mortal natures. Currently, she lives with ''[[DianeRivers|Diane Rivers]]'', one of the first Lost whom she became acquainted with after returning from the Hedge. Marissa even joined her soccer team.%0a[[%3c%3c]]%0a[[%3c%3c]]%0a%0ahttp://wantonwicked.gamingsandbox.com/wiki/images/ctl/headers/ctl_rph.png%0a%0a%25lfloat text-align=center margin-top=5px margin-right=25px margin-bottom=0px margin-left=0px newwin%25 http://s22.postimg.org/5pei1t341/marissa4.png%0a* The lost daughter returned: ''Marissa is still struggling with the fact that almost two decades have passed since she was abducted and that her family did not even realize she was gone. She wants to find out as much as possible about her parents and what happened to them while she was gone before deciding if she really should contact them or not. Of course, she also needs to keep tabs on her fetch as well. Anyone good at finding information in the mortal society would be able to help her with this.''%0a%0a* A fractured mind: ''Figments of humiliation, abuse, and torment haunts her dreams with reckless abandon, often leaving her ill rested as day breaks. Memories of Arcadia occasionally bubbles up from the darkest corners of her psyche, triggered by seemingly mundane occurances or events. She needs help to deal with her trauma and she knows it, trying to get some sort of councelling. If the opportunity arose, she would even procure pharmaceutical products or other substances to help soothe her inner demons.''%0a[[%3c%3c]]%0a[[%3c%3c]]%0a%25rfloat text-align=center margin-top=5px margin-right=0px margin-bottom=5px margin-left=15px newwin%25 http://s17.postimg.org/ghfpat20v/marissa5.png%0a* The end is neigh: ''The Gentry will be coming to take her back to Arcadia. Of this, Marissa has no doubts. Already, she has begun preparing for that day and she will be using any means necessary to stay out of the clutches of the Others. She attends all sorts of evening classes, she goes to the gym, she practices self-defence, she reads up on Lost history, she studies computer manuals; in short, she absorbs any piece of information she can from Lost, hobgoblins, and mortals alike.''%0a%0a* "I'm a necromancer, no wait, a vampire!": ''One of Marissa's favourite hobbies is LARP'ing and for several reasons. These events become an outlet for her emotions and frustrations, allowing her 'alter ego' to put words to her experiences in Arcadia without coming off as completely insane. Marissa actually enjoys LARPs so much that she has begun making her own costumes for these games. She would gladly meet with other enthusiasts, help set up a specific LARP in Savannah, or trade tips with other craftsmen that for one reason or another make clothes or other accessories.''%0a[[%3c%3c]]%0a[[%3c%3c]]%0ahttp://wantonwicked.gamingsandbox.com/wiki/images/ctl/headers/ctl_con.png%0a• Criminal world: ''When Marissa first returned to the human world, she had nothing.
