text=BIO: Chrys' mentor is Dr. James Oberth or -Phlogiston- to the Awakened community. He lives on a small hobby farm outside of Augusta where his family was originally from, living out his retirement at age 70. He graduated from Georgia State with a degree in Microbiology in 1965, then got a job at a water treatment facility where he worked for only 5 years. In 1970 he awakened to the Watchtower of the Lead Coin, joined the Atlanta Consillium as a member of the Mysterium. He continued his education, eventually getting his doctorate and went on to teach at the college level until his retirement. Since that time, he has been reknown as a talented Alchemist, and as a magus of the Uncrowned Kings, taught by a master of the legacy, now dead, who was known as -Crucible-. In his twighlight years -Phlogiston- has become more and more withdrawn and prone to the ravages of time. His behaviour by some is deemed erratic at best and dubbed dangerous on more than one occasion by the local Guardian caucus. Often he will go on rants, using some very specific jargon known only to Alchemists and even then it makes little if any sense to them at all. Still, he occasionally is invited to give special guest lectures on Thaumatology at various local Athauneums as he is well-versed in such occult knowledge for a number of years, one of which is consequently how Chrys met him nearly 8 years ago. There relationship is tenuous at best, -Phlogiston- seems more frequently distracted by wild theories these days, spending multiple weeks and sometimes multiple months in his lab, emerging only once in a great while to make some wild declarations and then to promptly dissappear again. He also lives about 3 hours away, on a remote farm north of Augusta near Steven Creeks. Getting there is time consuming, as physical presence is required for any contact with him because the old man rarely returns phone calls or (god forbid) emails. %0aHe is a very large man, standing at nearly 6' 5" and rounding 350 pounds, with a massive tangle of beard and hair.
