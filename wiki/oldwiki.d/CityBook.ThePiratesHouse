It is thought[by whom?] to be the oldest standing building in the state of Georgia.%0a%0aIt may not look like much on the outside, but the Pirate’s House has been seen more than a few days, more than a few faces, and has many secrets to tell. The wooden building, with washed out plank siding and simple post and lintel construction has been a mainstay of Savannah, for better or worse, since it first opened its doors in 1753. The Pirate House now is a popular tourist attraction, a pub and restaurant where one can come and get a meal and a drink in good company and the safety of friends.%0a%0aIt wasn’t always that way.%0a%0a%25rfloat text-align=center margin-top=5px margin-right=0px margin-bottom=5px margin-left=15px%25http://wantonwicked.gamingsandbox.com/wiki/images/mta/locations/thepirateshouse2.jpg%0aBack in the day the Pirate’s House had a different commodity that spirits and foods that it was famous for. Besides beer, food and wenches, the “Pirate House” did a brisk trade in something else; they found new sailors for the ships. Rather than going to all the trouble of convincing people of what a nice life it was at sea (people knew better) they simply kidnapped them.%0a%0aThis entry, you see, was the dumping point for men who had drank to much, been roofied by the owners of the bar, or just beaten over the head with a cudgel if they were stubborn enough to resist the loaded drinks. The good news, you could never say that the beer was watered down, the bad news, you could say that once you found yourself in the middle of an ocean. Once dumped into the tunnels, like this one,%0a%0a%25rfloat text-align=center margin-top=5px margin-right=0px margin-bottom=5px margin-left=15px%25http://wantonwicked.gamingsandbox.com/wiki/images/mta/locations/thepirateshouse5.jpg%0aConnect the Pirate’s house to hidden exit points along the Savannah. Unbeknownst to most people walking the street of Savannah, one of those tunnels still exists, connecting The Pirate’s House to Morrell Park, less than a quarter of a mile apart, one of the Ferry landings on the southern bank of the Savannah River. This is unknown to the sleepers, not so much to the Awakened.%0a%0aThe Pirate house still has some of those rooms open so that customers can see what life could have been like in the part, of course, the Consilium has a different use for those tunnels. One of the basement tunnels has a warded passage, a wall that is solid and innocuous to a sleeper as they suddenly remember it was time to go and have another drink, another cigarette, any normal and mundane reason not to tarry to long beneath the pub. To a sleepwalker, the tunnel itself is… interesting, but in the way that gives an itch to the back of the neck, and a desire to go and get some fresh air. For the Awakened, heading to the tunnel leads them to a dead end with a simple wrought Iron door that is locked. Speaking a simple incantation, an Atlantean word of power, opens the lock on the iron grate and allows the Awakened to travel a bit lower into the belly of Savannah.%0a%0a%25rfloat text-align=center margin-top=5px margin-right=0px margin-bottom=5px margin-left=15px%25http://wantonwicked.gamingsandbox.com/wiki/images/mta/locations/thepirateshouse3.jpg%0aMany have researched the iron gate, and while its metallurgical composition is nothing shocking, the spells cast on the item are impressive. Starting with a mask of normality that is consistently on, when High speech is uttered around the gate there is a triggered Sense consciousness before the gate then opens. As the gate opens it casts a, for lack of a better term, eternal now on any sleepers within the area, in the tunnels or directly about them. At the same time there is a temporary incognito presence and imposter cast on any awakened entering the gate. The combination works that the sleepers don’t see anyone passing through, forgetting the person there a minute ago, perhaps passing them off as a ghost… the building is haunted you know.%0a%0aThe combination of spells at the iron gate was placed by a master Mastigos in the early 1900’s, back when there was a revitalized interest in the darker histories of Savannah coincided with Prohibition. The basement of the Pirate’s House was first converted into a speak easy, the Awakened just assumed ownership of this portion of the building, making people forget about its existence. The basement has draught beer and a liquor shelf as stocked as the one above them in the main premises. Sadly, there is no kitchen in the basement, so the bar usually has pre-made sandwiches and bar nuts ( yes, the bar nuts are always stale.)%0a%0a%25rfloat text-align=center margin-top=5px margin-right=0px margin-bottom=5px margin-left=15px%25http://wantonwicked.gamingsandbox.com/wiki/images/mta/locations/thepirateshouse4.jpg%0aSince its inception, the Awakened have always been involved with the Pirate’s House in one way or another. Sometimes as staff, other times as managers and owners, the Awakened presence around the building has seeped into the frame. There is an overall positive vibe about the building, a distraction for those still asleep that allows them to relax, to enjoy. It allows for the Awakened to continue about their business with some freedom, and occasionally get a good buzz while doing it.%0a%0aThe Pirate’s house has changed hands between orders several times, sometimes used as a bartering chip, other times as a marker on a debt, the current owners of the Pirate House are the Silver Ladder. They manage the location with the understanding that all mages are welcome at the location. The Pirate’s house is one of three known Demenses in Savannah and the surrounding area.%0a%0a!!!Rules when at the Pirate’s house:%0a%0aMundane rules:%0a*Men -No Shoes, no Shirt, No Service.%0a*Women – No shirt, free drinks%0a*No Firearms, knives, weapons, cudgels or anything that might go boom.%0a*Always pay your tab.%0a*Do not eat the big white breath mint.%0a%0aSupernal Rules:%0a*Magic that influences another awakened or sleepwalker while in the boundaries of the Pirate’s House is forbidden.

Only the Awakened can pass through the gate. Even with an awakened chaperon, a sleeper or sleepwalker cannot pass through the gate, they will refuse to do so, suddenly compelled to escape the vicinity of the gate will all due speed. Attempts to trick the gate in the past have met with failure for the Awakened, and madness for the non-awakened participant. To try and bring a non-awakened through the gate, with the knowledge you are more than likely going to drive them mad or kill the non-awakened party, is a wisdom 6 morality check.%0a%0a'''Resonance:''' Unknown\\%0a'''Territory:''' [[Silver Ladder]], [[Consilium]]%0a[[#locationend]]%0a%0a----%0a(:include CityBook.Directory:)
