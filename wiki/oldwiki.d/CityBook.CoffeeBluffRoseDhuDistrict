The fishing isn't bad, but a lot of this area is fenced off by what appears to be a wildlife conservancy or some such, so the average (non-changeling) visitor would run into a fence barring entry to most of it. Still, though, the areas that are publicly accessible are nice enough, the edges of the rivers bottoming out into lovely little ponds. The undisturbed nature of the wildlife here means there's a lot of butterflies and frogs about, and during the day it’s a great place to take a hike. At night, though, or even the evenings, people do not hike around here; they don't do anything beyond leaving quickly.%0a%0aThere are rumors of small wolves or bobcats within the district, the accounts vary, and the descriptions are of a strange creature with fur that seems to stick down to its coat, no larger than a dog. They are said to be black and have an oily sheen to their coat, and, as the rumors go, are fond of the taste of human flesh. They appear to be nocturnal, and only attack people who spend too much time in the area past nightfall.%0a%0a!!Local History%0aWhite Bluff was a collection of communities—Nicholsonboro, Rose Dhu, Twin Hill, and Cedar Grove—located in Chatham County, Georgia, United States and now part of Savannah. In 1940, as part of research published in Drums and Shadows: Survival Studies Among the Georgia Coastal Negroes, the total population was estimated at 400. The communities were centered on White Bluff Road, eight miles southeast of Savannah.%0aDrum and Shadows describes White Bluff as a "quiet Negro community" where "moss-hung oaks form a canopy and cast filigreed shadows" upon the community's main road. Many of its older (as of 1940) inhabitants were former slaves on a large plantation on St. Catherines Island owned by Jacob Waldburg. They moved to White Bluff in 1868 after Waldburg reclaimed the island, which after the Civil War had been briefly reserved for freed slaves by General Sherman's Special Field Orders, No. 15.%0a%0a(:newpagebox base=CityBook template=CityBook.CBRDTemplate label="Create Coffee Bluff/Rose Dhu Location:" value="Place Name":)%0a%0a(:include GameRef.CityMaster#A#AEnd:)%0a%0a!!District Features:%0a>>lrindent frame border='1px solid #898989' bgcolor=#eeeeee padding=15px%3c%3c%0a'''City/Mortal''':%0a>>%3c%3c%0a%0a>>lrindent frame border='1px solid #005826' bgcolor=#eeeeee padding=15px%3c%3c%0a'''Changeling''':%0a*Hedgegate: Rose Dhu to Warren Alleyway%0a>>%3c%3c%0a%0a>>lrindent frame border='1px solid #003471' bgcolor=#eeeeee padding=15px%3c%3c%0a'''Mage''':%0a>>%3c%3c%0a%0a>>lrindent frame border='1px solid #9e0b0f' bgcolor=#eeeeee padding=15px%3c%3c%0a'''Vampire''':%0a* Domain of [[Players/Adair]], Circle of the Crone%0a* Location Rating: 3%0a* Tenants: Deirdre ni Morrighan, Goat%0a>>%3c%3c%0a%0a>>lrindent frame border='1px solid #74483f' bgcolor=#eeeeee padding=15px%3c%3c%0a'''Werewolf''':%0a>>%3c%3c%0a%0a!!District Locations:%0a(:sortable align=center:)%0a||class=sortable id=SGLocations%0a||!Location||!Venue||!Owner||%0a%0a(:tableend:)%0a%0a----%0a(:include CityBook.Directory:)
