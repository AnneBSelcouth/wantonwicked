Her blue eyes are probably her best feature, pretty and large and frequently wild.  Dishwater blonde bangs hang front of her eyes; the majority of her head shaved down into fuzz though the ring of long hair obscures this fact somewhat.  Though usually obscured by clothing it isn't too hard to tell that her frame is well-muscled; stronger than her small stature might suggest. %0a%0a%25color=#9c9c9c%25Amber seems to have an infinite closet of slightly shitty clothing; torn long-sleeved shirts, rugged jeans, boots -- all long wearing from Goodwill.  It would be easy to believe her waitress uniform is the nicest thing she owns and decidedly the most feminine.  In those moments when she’s not quite so ''angry'', Amber Rae manages a strange sort of appeal -- her cagey, mistrustful energy turned outward make her almost charismatic.  She becomes talkative and playful, if vulgar, and her honest interest in other people is undeniable.  But given her habit of swinging first verbally or otherwise, and the winged swastika tattooed across her chest, many people see the angry side as simply being more honest.  %0a[[%3c%3c]]%0a%25rfloat text-align=center margin-top=5px margin-right=15px margin-bottom=5px margin-left=5px width=400 newwin%25http://i77.photobucket.com/albums/j52/Kitsuiko/TestAmber02_zps0e1e33fe.jpg%0a%25width=200%25http://i77.photobucket.com/albums/j52/Kitsuiko/history_zps50c239b6.png%0a%25color=#9c9c9c%25Amber Rae’s story is similar to many in her hometown; a dad who was in prison by the time she was born and a mom who couldn’t cope and turned to whatever was convenient to not have to feel anything about it.  Still, she might have had a chance.  Her grandmother took care of the house and kept food on the table with her pension.  Amber got to see her dad and give him pictures she colored in pre-school and show off what tooth was wiggly.  There was a chance.  At least, until her stepfather Jimmy Jackson came into her life.  %0a%0a%25color=#9c9c9c%25The prison visits stopped.  The beatings started and all that light and cheer was stolen and an angry, angry little girl was forged into being instead.  Angry that social security checks were half used up on meth before the first week of the month.  Angry that life was a walk on egg-shells to not piss off Jimmy when he was drunk while her mother and grandmother turned a blind eye.  Angry at the second-hand clothes and the dirty looks from teachers and the other students.  By the time she was twelve Amber Rae had spent more days in suspension than she had in 6th grade -- why bother going into seventh?  %0a%0a%25rfloat text-align=center margin-top=5px margin-right=15px margin-bottom=5px margin-left=5px width=400%25http://i77.photobucket.com/albums/j52/Kitsuiko/TestAmber03_zps95326477.jpg%0a%25color=#9c9c9c%25It was no surprise when she started falling in with the crowd she did; breaking into cars for their stereo systems, mash-and-grab jobs on display windows, and stealing liquor down big shirts.  On one such outing she met Randall Wolfe who recognized the Algiz necklace she was wearing.  Whether it was love at first sight or just convenience; it hardly mattered.  Randall brought her to her first Aryan Revival rally at 14 and for the first time in her short life Amber felt as if she belonged.  Not just a burden on her grandmother, a piece of shit that her stepfather claimed or the trash that the schools thought she was -- she was a beautiful, strong white woman and that meant something.  She meant something.  It was hardly a surprise Amber Rae graduated to fist-fights and vandalism.  Juvenile hall was practically a revolving door; they barely bothered to clean up the room after she was released knowing she’d come back in a few months.  They were always right.  Maybe it would have just continued that way until prison if her grandmother hadn’t kicked her out when she was seventeen.%0a[[%3c%3c]]%0a%0a%25width=370%25http://i77.photobucket.com/albums/j52/Kitsuiko/roleplayhook_zps658404f9.png%0a%25rfloat text-align=center margin-top=5px margin-right=15px margin-bottom=5px margin-left=5px width=400 newwin%25http://i77.photobucket.com/albums/j52/Kitsuiko/TestAmber04_zps50e64cee.jpg%0a%25color=#999999%25'''Weirdness Magnet''' - (Mages; Sleepwalkers) It’s only been one year since Amber Rae learned there was more to the world.  And it’s been a hell of a year.  While she has no idea what’s going on her dogged persistence with trying to find out typically just leads her to go deeper and deeper down the rabbit hole.  Stories of some strange sleepwalker breaking into bookstores or making a smash and grab in curio-shoppes or even coming out of no where with baseball bat mid-swing have begun to spread in rumors and whispers.%0a%0a%25color=#999999%25'''A Long List of Priors''' - (Police; Criminal) Despite having her records sealed when she turned eighteen, Amber Rae still has had more than her fair share of time in custody as a ward of the state in Savannah Regional Youth Detention Center over the past five years.  Criminals who were brought in for “scared straight” programs, police officers trying to make kids see reason in their future, social workers concerned with what prospects were left and other wards of the state would all probably know the loud-mouth blonde who didn’t seem to know when to quit.%0a%25lfloat text-align=center margin-top=5px margin-right=15px margin-bottom=5px margin-left=5px width=400 newwin%25http://i77.photobucket.com/albums/j52/Kitsuiko/TestAmber06_zpsf0ec136a.jpg%0a%0a%25color=#999999%25'''Will You Be Having Dessert?''' - (Anyone) – Amber Rae works at '''[[Citybook.TheDineronAbercorn|The Diner on Abercorn]]''' as a waitress, a fact that is a surprise to many considering her typical demeanor not seeming to lend her well to customer service.  That said, her ability to recall orders and faces even weeks later has earned her points with regulars where her attitude would otherwise cause trouble.  She is typically scheduled for afternoons, however, due to a co-worker crippling irresponsibility Amber has been known to be there nights as well.  Those are typically not great nights for anyone.%0a %0a%25color=#999999%25'''6th Grade Occult Researcher''' - (Anyone) Despite truly wanting to learn more and research; Amber Rae is limited in the fact that her reading level is roughly that of a 6th grader.  Her vocabulary is occasionally enhanced by television or picking up words from conversation but her lack of formal education usually becomes painfully obvious.  In the best of conditions that would be difficult.  In Amber Rae’s case?  She frequently finds herself relying on other library patrons and visitors to help her understand what she just read and being accosted by a teenager asking for help with The Corpus Hermeticum stands out.  %0a%0a%25width=275%25http://i77.photobucket.com/albums/j52/Kitsuiko/contacts_zps8100c1a1.png%0a[[%3c%3c]]%0a%25lfloat width=110px%25 http://img841.imageshack.us/img841/5407/vpvr.png%0a%25color=#9c9c9c%25'+[[Aemry Wiseman]]+' '''Friend and Co-Conspirator''' It would be actively difficult to imagine a pair that seemed more mismatched than the quiet, polite Aemry and the loud, crass Amber Rae -- but there's no small amount of clear loyalty the younger woman pays to her intellectual friend.  While their study sessions are ''theoretically'' themed around helping Amber prepare for her GED; neither the Initiation into Hermetics nor the Compedium Maleficarum are typical topics.%0a[[%3c%3c]]%0a%25lfloat width=110px%25 http://i21.photobucket.com/albums/b279/darkestdreaming/0f5bcb78-0741-4cdd-8a3a-bdc0ba5fc03f_zps6fe1df12.jpg%0a%25color=#9c9c9c%25'+[[Genevieve Keen]]+' '''Friend; Math Tutor''' It wouldn't be right to call Amber protective over Genevieve; she tends to back off when conflicts happen and let the other eighteen year old handle it herself.  However, it would be hard to miss that after each Amber's usually there with a supportive side-hug and a few whispered words.  For Genevieve's part, she seems to be one of the few who can effectively reel Amber Rae back with a few words.  %0a[[%3c%3c]]%0a[[%3c%3c]]%0a[[%3c%3c]]%0a%25lfloat text-align=center margin-top=5px margin-right=15px margin-bottom=5px margin-left=0px width=350 newwin%25http://i77.photobucket.com/albums/j52/Kitsuiko/baseballbat_zps6674e05e.jpg %0a%25width=200%25http://i77.photobucket.com/albums/j52/Kitsuiko/quotes_zps8bba15c2.png%0a%25color=#9c9c9c%25''[[https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sCiAYmhJJ70|You made my shit list.]]''%0a->%25right%25%25color=#565051%25[- - '''[[Amber Rae Volmer]]'''-]%0a%0a%0a%25color=#9c9c9c%25''She's got it all figured out.

Still, she might have had a chance.  Her grandmother took care of the house and kept food on the table with her pension.  Amber got to see her dad and give him pictures she colored in pre-school and show off what tooth was wiggly.  There was a chance.  At least, until her stepfather Jimmy Jackson came into her life.  %0a%3c %0a%3c %25color=#9c9c9c%25The prison visits stopped.  The beatings started and all that light and cheer was stolen and an angry, angry little girl was forged into being instead.  Angry that social security checks were half used up on meth before the first week of the month.  Angry that life was a walk on egg-shells to not piss off Jimmy when he was drunk while her mother and grandmother turned a blind eye.  Angry at the second-hand clothes and the dirty looks from teachers and the other students.  By the time she was twelve Amber Rae had spent more days in suspension than she had in 6th grade -- why bother going into seventh?  %0a%3c %0a%3c %25color=#9c9c9c%25It was no surprise when she started falling in with the crowd she did; breaking into cars for their stereo systems, mash-and-grab jobs on display windows, stealing liquor down big shirts, getting into fist fights in parking lots, and getting so piss-drunk that the cops were called to do something about those damn kids.  Juvenile hall was practically a revolving door; they barely bothered to clean up the room after she was released knowing she’d come back in a few months.  They were always right.  Maybe it would have just continued that way if her grandmother hadn’t kicked her out when she was seventeen. %0a%3c [[%3c%3c]]%0a%3c %0a%3c %25width=370%25http://i77.photobucket.com/albums/j52/Kitsuiko/roleplayhook_zps658404f9.png%0a%3c %25rfloat text-align=center margin-top=5px margin-right=15px margin-bottom=5px margin-left=0px width=350 newwin%25http://i77.photobucket.com/albums/j52/Kitsuiko/AmberRae02_zpsaeeaa907.jpg%0a%3c %25color=#999999%25'''Weirdness Magnet''' - (Mages; Sleepwalkers) It’s only been one year since Amber Rae learned there was more to the world.  And it’s been a hell of a year.  While she has no idea what’s going on her dogged persistence with trying to find out typically just leads her to go deeper and deeper down the rabbit hole.  Stories of some strange sleepwalker breaking into bookstores or making a smash and grab in curio-shoppes or even coming out of no where with baseball bat mid-swing have begun to spread in rumors and whispers.%0a%3c %0a%3c %25color=#999999%25'''A Long List of Priors''' - (Police; Criminal) Despite having her records sealed when she turned eighteen, Amber Rae still has had more than her fair share of time in custody as a ward of the state in Savannah Regional Youth Detention Center over the past five years.  Criminals who were brought in for “scared straight” programs, police officers trying to make kids see reason in their future, social workers concerned with what prospects were left and other wards of the state would all probably know the loud-mouth blonde who didn’t seem to know when to quit.%0a%3c %0a%3c %25color=#999999%25'''Will You Be Having Dessert?''' - (Anyone) – Amber Rae works at [[Citybook.TheDineronAbercorn|The Diner on Abercorn]] as a waitress, a fact that is a surprise to many considering her typical demeanor not seeming to lend her well to customer service.

Those are typically not great nights for anyone.%0a%3c  %0a%3c %25color=#999999%25'''6th Grade Occult Researcher''' - (Anyone) Despite truly wanting to learn more and research; Amber Rae is limited in the fact that her reading level is roughly that of a 6th grader.  Her vocabulary is occasionally enhanced by television or picking up words from conversation but her lack of formal education usually becomes painfully obvious.  In the best of conditions that would be difficult.  In Amber Rae’s case?  She frequently finds herself relying on other library patrons and visitors to help her understand what she just read and being accosted by a teenager asking for help with The Corpus Hermeticum stands out.  %0a%3c %0a%3c %0a%3c %25width=275%25http://i77.photobucket.com/albums/j52/Kitsuiko/contacts_zps8100c1a1.png%0a%3c [[%3c%3c]]%0a%3c %25lfloat width=70px%25 http://wantonwicked.gamingsandbox.com/wiki/images/silhouette.png%0a%3c %25color=#9c9c9c%25'+[[PC Connection]]+' '''What We Are to Each Other''' Here's where I talk about how much I like and or dislike you; possibly with a bit explaining how we met.
