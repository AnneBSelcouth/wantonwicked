text=(:notitle:)%0ahttp://wantonwicked.gamingsandbox.com/wiki/images/vampiretherequiem.png%0a%0a!!Insomnium Revised%0aAn Alucinor with any level of Insomnium counts as a Lucid Dreamer (a la Changeling) with regards to shaping their own dreams and defending against other Oneiromancers. They add their rating in the Insomnium discipline to their rolls instead of Wyrd.%0a%0aIt is recommended that any potential player of an Alucinor have access to the Oneiromancy books in the Changeling: the Lost core, as these rules reference them frequently.%0a%0a*Dreams of the many (o)%0a**Cost: None for specific targets, 1 Willpower for Prophetic scans.%0a**Dice Pool: Wits + Empathy + Insomnium – target Dream Intensity (Determined with a Wits + **Resolve roll for the target character). Wits + Occult + Insomnium to scan Prophetic Dreams.%0a**Action: Instant, possibly resisted.%0a%0a**Dramatic Failure: Pieces of dreams wash over the Alucinor's mind, causing hallucinations and disorientation. Roll the target dream Intensity (if targeted) or the character's own Presence; success causes a -1 penalty per success to Resolve or Composure based rolls for the rest of the scene. If this happens multiple times, it's cumulative, as the character becomes more and more absorbed into the fantasy.%0a**Failure: Nothing but incoherent fragments of dreams and subconscious thoughts.%0a**Success: For as long as the character concentrates, he's able to watch the dream of the targeted character, and essentially gains information as if using an “Analyze the Dream” action. This means that the Oneiromancer can determine if the dream is prophetic, and what type of dream it may be otherwise (Recurring, Memory, Wish Fulfillment, Nightmare). Alternatively, he can scan for traces of Prophetic Dreams amongst the sleeping masses, and on a success, either may watch them and gain important clues, if the Storyteller deems it appropriate, or may instead simply apply their 'knowledge' to a single reroll of a failed action in the same night.%0a**Exceptional Success: On an exceptional success for specific dream watching, if the Alucinor commits to watching the entirety of a night's dreams from the victim, he can also learn one of either the victim's Virtue, Vice, Morality/Humanity/etc, a derangement, her Willpower (permanent), a mental/social merit, a mental/social flaw, the signs of a Diablerist, or the presence of mind/emotion altering supernatural powers used on the victim in the past month. Mechanically, this is equivalent to a “Learn about the Dreamer” action. An exceptional success also grants a +1 to one further use of the Discipline on the same target within the next month.%0a**Prophecy-seeking rolls gain no extra benefit from an exceptional success, though a Storyteller might allow more detailed information to be gleaned.%0a%0a**An Alucinor who swims the sea of dreams is still aware of her own surroundings. If she performs an action aside from meddling in dreams, the connection to her subject is broken immediately.%0a%0a**Additional Suggested Modifiers:%0a***Target is a Lucid Dreamer of any kind: +1, but they can roll Wits + Empathy (+ Wyrd/Gnosis/Insomnium) as a contested roll.%0a%0a%0a*Oneiromancy (oo)%0a**Cost: 1 Vitae%0a**Dice Pool: Composure + Empathy + Insomnium to initiate, Wits + Empathy + Insomnium - **Intensity to Dream Ride.%0a**Action: Extended, target of Dream Intensity to initiate. Varies for Dream Riding.%0a%0a**Dramatic Failure: The target immediately snaps awake, thus making it impossible to continue or to try again until they've fallen asleep and are dreaming again. In addition, an image of the vampire is stuck in their mind, meaning they'll likely be able to associate the Alucinor with the odd dream that startled them awake.%0a**Failure: No successes are accumulated.%0a**Success: If the target successes are met, the character is able to project themselves, in any form they desire, into the victim's dreams. Once there, Wits + Empathy + Insomnium – Intensity can be rolled to make changes, to subtly influence in the target (perhaps gaining a bonus to social rolls with them equal to a single roll representing a night's work, I.e a “Convince the Dreamer” action), lower the intensity of their current dream, search for supernaturally-induced dreams, or similar.  While in a dream, he may also engage in Oneiromachy, attacking the dreamer or another Oneiromancer in a form of dream combat, those damaged losing willpower instead of health.  Combat dice pools within a Dream have their Attribute replaced with the highest Power trait the character possesses, with an 'equipment' bonus equal to dots in Insomnium, or one may alternatively shape the dream to attack for him with the normal Dream-Riding roll. Defense is the highest Finesse trait, and Armor is equivalent to the highest Resistance trait. With regards to Changeling dream rules, the Alucinor may, while in a dream, engage in any Dream-Riding action, as well as Oneiromachy, with the normal rules for such. Lucid Dreamers of any kind can attempt to undo or contest the Alucinor's actions, and this is resolved by simply comparing successes (the greater amount takes precedence).%0a**Exceptional Success: More successes gained towards total. If 5+ more successes are rolled than are needed on the last roll, the Dream's intensity can be moved up or down by one point as the Alucinor wishes.%0a%0a**Additional Modifiers%0a***Target is a Lucid Dreamer of any kind: +1, but they can contest as above%0a***Target is a Changeling in a Dream-Tasked Pledge with the Alucinor (Doesn't stack with above): +2%0a%0a%0a*Chain the Enslumbered Mind (ooo)%0a**In medieval literature, victims of succubi or incubi describe their dreams as seeming unnaturally real, affecting their waking hours and running the images through their minds constantly. Modern Psychology simply considers such odd dreams to be a product of brain chemistry or particularly vivid memories or experiences, but an Alucinor can weave these sorts of dreams at will.%0a**This power can only be inflicted on an already sleeping target, but one that is not yet in REM sleep, whether because they simply haven't started dreaming yet, or because the Alucinor has used the second level of this discipline to scour away or break down the Intensity of the dream to 0.%0a%0a**Cost: 1 Vitae%0a**Dice Pool: Intelligence + Empathy + Insomnium vs Wits + Resolve%0a**Action: Instant, Contested%0a%0a**Dramatic Failure: The target immediately awakens, ejecting the Vampire from their mind and preventing them from attempting this power again in the same night. Vampires targeted wake up without a humanity roll if it's daytime, but need to spend vitae as normal if appropriate.%0a**Failure: If the subject rolls more successes, a dream begins with Intensity equal to the net successes they rolled, but that the Vampire has no control over the content of.%0a**Success: If the Alucinor rolls more successes, a dream begins with Intensity equal to net successes. Dreams created from “whole cloth”, so to speak, can have more profound effects than simply altering an existing dream with Oneiromancy. A dream that soothes the body and urges it towards recovery might count as a day of rest (“Healing Sleep”). If the Alucinor knows the target's Vice and Virtue, he can induce a dream that makes the target feel as if they've fulfilled their vice, gaining a point of willpower for it (“Stress Relief”). And by sending a dream filled with knowledge the Alucinor contains, a skill or merit (or Discipline, for another Vampire or a ghoul) can be taught in a much shorter time period with a 'dream montage' (“Sleep Teaching”). Alternatively, the Alucinor may simply send a terrifying nightmare, which, if Intensity is higher than the target's Willpower, causes them not to regain any upon waking.  With Storyteller permission, the Alucinor may specifically weave dream archetypes as explained in Dancers in the Dusk (pg 19-24), utilizing appropriate traits (Insomnium instead of Wyrd, Vitae instead of Glamour).  This power can only be used (successfully) once per night per target.%0a**Exceptional Success: If the NET successes is five or more, the following benefits are gleaned: Healing sleep counts as two days of rest, Stress Reflief dreams can fulfill Virtue, and Sleep Teaching can grant a bonus xp towards learning that one trait alone (This cannot be stacked, and a target can only benefit from one such xp at a time until it's spent).%0a%0a**Additional Modifiers:%0a***Target is a Lucid Dreamer of any kind: +1, but they can alter the dream once it's made%0a***Target is a Changeling in a Dream-Tasked Pledge with the Alucinor (Doesn't stack with above): +2%0a%0a%0a*Blissful Sleep (oooo)%0a**By the book, but “mortal” includes any non-undead supernaturals.%0a%0a%0a*Travails of Morpheus (ooooo)%0a**Cost: 1 Vitae%0a**Dice Pool: Intelligence + Subterfuge + Insomnium%0a**Action: Reflexive%0a%0a**Note: This permits the Alucinor's next Oneriomachy attack (personal or enviromental) to do Bashing damage to their victim in addition to the usual Willpower loss.%0a**Dramatic Failure: The Insomnium user is stunned for a turn as their own nightmares rise and overwhelm their senses.%0a**Failure: The attack proceeds as normal.%0a**Success: The Alucinor's next Oneriomachy attack (personal or enviromental) does Bashing damage to their victim in addition to the usual Willpower loss.
