Savannah is a city that survived a siege in the Revolutionary war, which survived the coming of Sherman in the Civil War, which survived the racial tensions of the Civil Rights movement, and continues to survive today in the worst job market seen since the depression of the 1930’s. Savannah is a city that has persevered, that has survived, and like the city, the awakened of Savannah know what it means to survive. Attacked from outside and from within, the Awakened continue to fight back, to rebuild after one of the most traumatic experience in their Consilium’s long history.%0a%0a%25center%25Moving to the town like a ghost in the rain\\%0aA dim reflection in a dark window pane\\%0aBlackness beckons from every side\\%0aCreeping all around like an incoming tide\\%0aA broken window in an empty house\\%0aI slip inside and begin to douse\\%0aThe whole place with the fuel that will feed the fire\\%0aAnd push back the night, taking me higher\\%0aOn out of the darkness in a deafening roar\\%0aThe match in my hand is the key to the door\\%0aA simple turn of the wrist will suffice\\%0aTo open a passage to paradise\\%0aI pause, I think about the past and the gloom\\%0aThe smell of gasoline permeates the room\\%0aEveryone has a little secret he keeps\\%0aI light the fires while the city sleeps%25center%25%0a%0a%0aThe history of the awakened of Savannah exists well before these modern nights, a story that goes back before settlers arrived in the area. The story begins with Hattan, an almost mythological figure who predated European presence in the area. Hattan, his disappearance and the rumor of his ascension to archmastery, is only one of the many unanswered secrets of the city. For now there is the enemy beneath the streets, the spiritual dead zone that is the city proper, and the regular appearance of the Seer of the Throne known as “Metric” that has the attention of the Consilium. The orders are restocked, the secrets are slowly coming to light, the question now is, “what will be the price of the answers?” Savannah has a history dipped in the blood of the Wise, painted with liberal strokes, and creating a picture that many will not be willing to see.%0a%0a%25center%25The match makes a graceful arc to the floor\\%0aAnd time stands still as I turn for the door\\%0aWhich explodes in a fireball and throws me to the street\\%0aI hit the ground running with the flames at my feet\\%0aReaching for the night which recoils from the fire\\%0aThe raindrops hiss like a devilish choir\\%0aDying in the flames with a terrible sound\\%0aCalling all the names of the sleepers all around\\%0aBut then in the arms of the night, they lay\\%0aTheir dreams sprout wings and fly away\\%0aOut of the houses in a gathering flock\\%0aSwarming overhead as I hurry down the block\\%0aI make my escape with the greatest of ease\\%0aAnd savor the darkness, drop to my knees\\%0aAnd the lightless window, my hand on the latch\\%0aI reach in my pocket, and pull out a match\\%0a-MC 900 Foot Jesus- The City Sleeps%25center%25%0a%0a%0aMage is a game of modern horror, knowing too much is as dangerous as not knowing enough, sadly, there is no guide to tell you about the perfect mix.

Modern Savannah is built on the lands once held by the Guale Indians. With the Timucua to the South and the Creek Indians to the West, the Gaule held a fertile section of what would eventually become Georgia. Their Lands extended north to the future border of South Carolina and their Eastern extent was the Atlantic Ocean. The Guale had seen the incursion of the French, and of the Spanish, and though their Awakened numbers were small, they were organized under the Leadership of the Guale Shaman known only as ''Hattan''.  ''Hattan'', both a shaman for his people and a Thyrsus, had tilled and worked the land with his own hands, he was a supposed master of the Life and Spirit arcanas, and if the rumors were true, was also a master of prime as well. The lands of the Guale were lush, and were coveted by the Yamasee and Creek tribes. Because of this, the Guale were constantly in a defensive state, not looking to expand their boarders as much as seeking to protect what they already had.%0a%0aIt was 1563 and an expedition  led by Jean Ribault, a French naval officer, brought ''Hattan'' in contact with a member of the Awakened from Europe.  Among Ribault’s party was a mage known as ''Gideon''.  ''Gideon'' had joined Ribault’s party as a spiritual advisor, though his other mission was a bit more serious. ''Gideon'' was an advance scout sent by the Paris Consilium meant to make contact with the Awakened in the New World.  Most of ''Gideon’s'' accounts were of modern day South Carolina, but as Ribault moved farther south ''Gideon'' would encounter  ''Hattan'' and the Gaule. Luckily ''Gideon'' was wise enough to come as a supplicant and not a conqueror, and an uneasy friendship was struck up. ''Hattan'' learned of the organization and the size of the European Awakened, and ''Gideon'' learned of something far greater. ''Hattan'' had been shaping the land and the ley lines in a project that had taken most of his life. Slow cultivation of the powerful nodes of Awakened Magic, it was ''Hattan’s'' Mission to create a self-sustaining network of nodes that would nourish the land, and the people in turn.%0a%0a''Gideon'' was wise enough to display awe instead of a more covetous nature. ''Gideon'' knew he had to report of this experiment to the Paris Consilium, but had no means to do so until Ribault pushed on. Acting as counsel to Ribault, he convinced the French explorer to push farther South and into the lands of the Spaniards in the hopes of contacting more of the Awakened from the old world. With feigned reluctance, ''Gideon'' took his leave of ''Hattan'', a new mission assigned by himself, now of paramount importance.  ''Hattan'', who was cautious, did not know of ''Gideon’s'' f thoughts, and had little choice in what he must do. ''Hattan'' began redoubled his efforts on his project, his goal to see his people prosper and be protected the forefront thought in his mind.%0a%0a''Gideon'' would continue to travel with Ribault until Ribault and many of his party were ambushed and killed near the Spanish Settlement of St. Augustine. ''Gideon'' was taken “prisoner” by an Awakened member of the Spaniard contingent, an Adamantine Arrow known as ''Falchion''.  ''Falchion'' arranged for ''Gideon’s'' ransom under the guise of ''Gideon'' being a Roman Catholic priest. _''Gideon'' was careful not to mention ''Hattan'' or his project, keeping that information for his superiors. ''Gideon'' feared that the Spanish Awakened would act before he could report his findings to his colleagues in Paris, and so ''Gideon'' waited, suffering the trip across the Atlantic with a barely contained excitement. ''Hattan’s'' work, in this wild and untamed land, was something not seen in Europe, a place where boundaries and cities had been established for centuries.%0a%0a%0a[%25color=#365776%25[[#top| Back to top]]]%0a%0a%0a[[#PT2]]%0a!!Change%0a%0a''Gideon'' did survive his travel back to the Paris Consilium, but the greeting he expected from his order, and the Consilium, was less than he had hoped for. Seers had pushed against the Paris Consilium, and there was an open war fought with rapier and main gauche, covert spells and assassinations, that filled the streets of Paris. ''Gideon’s'' news of a fantastic experiment in the New World was not worthy enough of his order’s full attention, there was a price in blood that was the forefront thought of the Consilium, and the Consilium had been martialed for war. ''Gideon'', knowing that the war was likely to be a long one, looked for other options. In a series of political moves, ''Gideon'' was assigned as an ambassador of his order to other cities and other Consili. For the next 10 years ''Gideon'' travelled throughout France, looking for a Consilium to fund a voyage back to the New World. He was met with political infighting and skepticism. The Old World had seen, had done, it all. How had such a wild land been able to produce greater works than the Masters of Europe? ''Gideon'' was not a man of prophecy, his knowledge of fate and time was a hindrance, but he had his own vision of ''Hattan’s'' project, one that was for the benefit of the European Awakened as they made it to the New World. It was in desperation that ''Gideon'' made what some might consider a deal with a Devil. It was 1575 when ''Gideon'' left France and made his way to England, specifically, the Consilium of London.%0a%0aThe English were much more receptive to the information that ''Gideon''  Provided. There were no English settlements in the New World at this time, and ''Gideon’s'' tales of the new World Sparked an excitement within the Consilium of London. ''Gideon'' would spend the rest of his time in England, knowing that he would be considered a pariah in his home country and the Paris Consilium. Through a network of contacts, ''Gideon'' learned that the Paris Consilium was bled close to dry in the war with the Seers, a war that lasted two years. This was one of the last things ''Gideon'' would learn, he succumbed to the outbreak of Typhus in the city of Oxford in 1577. His work, however, spurred the Awakened to push the English colonization of the New World. In 1578 Walter Raleigh would lead the first expedition to the New World, only to be turned back. It would not be until 1607 that the English would finally make a foothold in North America with the settlement of Jamestown ion 1607.%0a''Hattan'' had not been idle during this time, though he had become a recluse in many ways. His project took all of his time, the crafting of land pushed his knowledge of the Supernal and of the mundane world to new heights. In the time ''Gideon'' had been gone ''Hattan'' and reshaped and moved nodes, healed and created new ley lines, altered the geography of the land, and worked incessantly on his wonder. His focus was drifting away from the fallen world and was taking him on a path to greater understanding of the supernal. He became a living myth to his people, the shaman of the shamans. There was even talk of him becoming a living ancestor, an avatar of the spirits of the Gaule.%0a%0aWhile ''Hattan'' delved deeper into the supernal his people fought to survive. Never warlike, the Gaule were hard pressed to survive with the  warlike Creek as their neighbor. First influenced by the French, the Spanish soon took an interest in the Guele and tried desperately to incorporate them into their Mission System of colonization. At first the Guale  seemed to acclimate to the Spanish, but the Guale were too far away from the powerbase the Spanish had in St. Augustine. As a mission province, the Guale were unstable, and in 1597 there was a revolt against the system. Part of the Guale ability to survive was the continued relationship with the French, one kept in secret, which allowed them to avoid the full incorporation into the Spanish System.%0a%0aFor a while there was an uneasy balance of power, the Guale continued to survive, but each year saw them holding on with less of a grip to their ancestral lands. The English colonization of the mid-Atlantic was comparatively quick. After the settlement of Jamestown in Virginia the English quickly asserted themselves up and down the Atlantic seaboard. In 1670 the English founded their southernmost settlement with Charleston. By 1675 Indian tribes supported by the British were attacking and destroying missions created by the Spanish. Because this was done by Native Americans the Spanish were unable to hold the English accountable. For most this seemed simple nationalistic combat, countries fighting over new resources. While the Spanish have no record of Awakened involvement, the London Consilium knows full and well that the Awakened pushed many of these combats. They were fueled with the knowledge left behind by ''Gideon'', and their own resources with fate told of a great wonder being created in the lands of the Guale.%0a%0aThough it is not talked about, it is said that an order of Awakened introduced various diseases into the area to force the Guale into capitulation. Small Pox, Typhus, and other diseases ravaged the natives, forcing them to create amalgamation of tribes that would be called the Yamasee.  For several years this group would try to exist despite disease and intertribal warfare.  After the Yamasee wars in South Carolina, and with the British Invasion of Florida in 1702, the Yamasee, nee Guale, were virtually extinct. Of ''Hattan'' and his work there was no word, ''Hattan'' had vanished sometime in the 1600’s and had not been heard of save for the myths and the legends of his people. There was no news of his wonder, or his work. The British were ready to create a settlement, and in 30 years, Savannah would be born.%0a%0a%0a[%25color=#365776%25[[#top| Back to top]]]%0a%0a[[#PT3]]%0a!!Savannah%0a%0a''Hattan'' had vanished, and it was unknown if his work was finished or not. The area that would become Savannah was teeming with ley energy, Nodes of various sizes had been organized, plotted for some reason that the native Awakened could not divine. Fate Magic, Time, dreaming and trips into the Astral realms gave no clue as to the purpose of ''Hattan’s'' work. His secret had vanished with him, threads of fate had been severed, and his great work was useless to the remaining Awakened among the Native Americans. Right before Oglethorpe would land on American soil a new tribe of Indians, The Yamacraw, would form in preparation for the Arrival of settlers. Tomochichi, the first leader of the Yamacraw, would form his tribe from the survivors of the Yamasee and Creek who had disagreed with the breaking of the Friendship with the British during the Yamasee War. Little did Tomochichi know that the counsel he received was from many Awakened who knew of the impending arrival of English settlers. The tribe built a village near what is modern day Savannah, a supernal guard to make sure that the settlement would go unobstructed.%0a%0aJames Oglethorpe arrived in 1732 with 114 colonists in tow. Several members of the Awakened were present, most notably the Mysterium and the Adamantine Arrow. The first act of these European Awakened was to contact their brethren in the Yamacraw. The resulted in the peaceful moving of the Yamacraw tribe farther North along the Savannah River, thus giving the Europeans free reign in the area. These plans all came from ''Gideon’s'' notes, his ideas, and his plans there were laid out almost 150 years prior to the arrival of the English. ''Hattan’s'' project was taken without bloodshed, and immediately the Awakened went to work.%0a%0aSome would like to think that Oglethorpe himself was a mage. The layout of Savannah was unique in its day, and remains so even now. %0a%0ahttp://wantonwicked.gamingsandbox.com/wiki/images/mta/history/mtahistory1.jpg%0a%0aThe plan for the city was unlike earlier settlements, and built one stage atop the other in an ordered form. This unnatural city design, the way that it appeared to be geometrically and numerically precise and the way it captured the nodes left behind by ''Hattan'' was not unintentional, but it was not Oglethorpe who was the mage,%0a%0a%25lfloat text-align=center margin-top=5px margin-right=15px margin-bottom=5px margin-left=0px%25http://wantonwicked.gamingsandbox.com/wiki/images/mta/history/mtahistory2.jpg%0aEach ward was preconceived  before the settlers had ever set foot on American soil, the note left by ''Gideon'' and ample use of Space and fate magic gave the travelling Awakened a virtual map to design with. Once they arrived they quickly adapted their plans and set forth in creating the street and block pattern that Savannah is now famous for. Oglethorpe, thinking the idea his own, quickly implemented this project, but it was the subtle guidance of the mages ''Ledger'' and ''Dragoon'' that gave Oglethorpe inspiration. %0a%0aSavannah quickly took shape, and while the European Awakened could not fathom ''Hattan’s'' plans any more than their Native American counterparts, they did create a wonder of their own. As the lands were shaped for the buildings and roads the ley lines began to move. Subtle changes at first, but the nodes and the lines began to parallel the creation of the city. Within a decade there were 12 wards, each one centered atop a node, ley lines of consistent power flowing between them, and then, something truly wondrous happened. Wondrous, and very dangerous.%0a%0aHallows began to appear, producing tass in various forms, and then they would vanish. The Node system appeared to act as a battery, generating arcane power until it was full before a Hallow would appear and the mana would coalesce into tass. The first of these hallows appeared in 1745, twelve years after the founding of the city, but only 5 years after the completion of the last ward. The few Guardians of the Veil in the city were quick and careful to act, using smoke and mirrors to distract the populace as the Mysterium went to work harvesting the Tass. The hallow stayed active for a week, but the amount of tass retrieved before it disappearance was rumored to be 50 pawns. Had the Awakened stumbled on the purpose of ''Hattan’s''  Project? Did ''Hattan'' understand the concept of a battery well before one had ever been made?  The Consilium of Savannah met immediately after the hallow disappeared, their number was small, only 10 members largely comprised of the Mysterium and the Adamantine Arrow. The Guardians of the Veil member counseled caution, to wait and see if the event would happen again, before then deciding to tell other Consili about this wonder. The Silver Ladder balked at the Idea, wanting to share the information, and the wealth of the new world, to earn a place among the larger established Consili by right of their wonder. The Arrow agreed with the Guardians, their number was not great and there would be those who would try and take the wonder by force. They did not avoid the confrontation, but they counseled that only the desperate created a war they would lose. The Mysterium… said nothing. %0a%0aEventually the compromise on patience won out, though party did agree to inform parent Consili and other Consili of this wonder should it repeat itself. The orders waited, the city grew, and time passed. There was certain anxiousness in the air for the first few years after the event. The Awakened watched as the ley lines seem to establish themselves. Geomancers among the wise were amazed at the intricate network that seemed vibrant enough to be self-contained.  Powerful lines left the city, heading towards South Carolina and the city of Charlestown, as well as to the West, towards what would become Atlanta. Another major artery headed south, into the Spanish territory of Florida. But the ley lines did not take magic in as much as they pushed magic out, Instead of one large node like a power plant, there was a grid of nodes producing enough ley energy that the stream only seemed to head away  from Savannah. The area around the city flourished, there were good yields in crops and in fauna. ''Hattan’s'' efforts, for whatever reason, had created something vibrant, something alive. There was less disease, fewer deaths from age, and people, in general, found a good life in Savannah.%0a%0a1760, Fifteen years after the first hallow appeared, in the middle of a storm that had bracketed the coast for days, the second hallow appeared. Once again the Awakened quickly worked together, distracting the mortal population, which had grown since the last event, while harvesting the tass in the middle of the storm. Again, the Hallow remained active for a week, The awakened very carefully directed people away from the area, claiming other areas of the town needed assistance before working in the area the hallow had appeared. It was not the same location as the time before, instead appearing in a different ward.  This time the haul was larger, 75 pawns of tass pulled in just under a week. Each one carefully cultivated and separated from the Hallow. There were other more traditional hallows about Savannah, they would stay active if tended, and some cabals had found and tended to them for years, but nothing like these hallows produced by the node network.%0a%0aJust as before, the Consilium met, this time their numbers had grown, it had been years, and 20 awakened now returned to the argument of what to do with the knowledge, and the wonder, that they had found.%0a%0ahttp://wantonwicked.gamingsandbox.com/wiki/images/mta/history/mtahistory3.jpg%0a%0a%0a%0a[%25color=#365776%25[[#top| Back to top]]]%0a%0a[[#PT4]]%0a!!Debate%0a%0aSavannah was larger, the Consilium was established and growing, and the hallows, with their caches of tass, had again appeared 15 years to the day after the first sighing of what some now called “''Hattan'' Hallows.” The Consilium had agreed to discuss what should be done if the event had occurred again, and  true to its word, the debate began. It was not a simple thing, instead a long and arduous process that divided orders on how they should respond. The worst division was in the Mysterium, some wanted to hide the wonder, study it, reverse engineer it workings. They believed that, in time, they could decipher the spells and the components of a device that did not appear to have a physical form. Others in the Mysterium felt that it was foolish not to utilize the resources of the order, to use the knowledge held in the Athenaeums of other cities. It was as close to kin-strife as it could be, with no few duels occurring because of slights, both supposed and real. The representatives of the other orders watched this internal war, smaller version of it playing out within their own orders. The Silver Ladder wanted to announce the wonder as a jewel of the Savannah Consilium, their idea was to parlay its existence for a bigger stake in the new colonies and for legitimization in the old world. Politics all the way, the Ladder had a few among them who cautioned with words like “Hubris” and “Hamartia.” The Adamantine Arrow, surprisingly, was also divided. There were those who felt that their defense of an object, a wonder such as this, was a way to gain recognition. The desire to sacrifice for the Consilium and the wise in service rang true in the ears of many, while others counseled patience, that the knowledge of such a wonder would draw more than just idle attention and curiosity. One of the few orders without strife was the Guardians of the Veil. They sought to protect the sleeping world from the machinations of the Awakened, and their policy was simple: hide what needed hidden, protect the Veil, and protect the Consilium.%0a%0aThe final decision, reached a year after the Hallows had appeared and vanished, was made, and knowledge of the wonder was spread to various Consili. In North America an Envoy was sent first to South Carolina, Charleston being the nearest neighboring Consilium, before moving on to Jamestown and eventually Boston. Another envoy was sent to Europe, visiting the Consili of England. The Awakened of Savannah agreed that their work would not be shared with the French or Spanish Consili, some mundane superstitions and national pride still remained. The envoy to the Americas returned in just over a year, their travels brought with them a handful of new Awakened, mostly of the Mysterium and the Silver Ladder, but also returned with the most interesting of attitudes. The Northern Consili had reacted to the story of ''Hattan’s'' wonder with suspicion, with denial that something so grand would be found in the youngest of the Colonies. The Boston Consilium was the worst with,  “an attitude of superiority that was thicker than fresh butter” or so the envoy said. Those who arrived were welcomed, and offered chances to join the Savannah Consilium. Most of them, younger mages, took the opportunity with relish, like indentured servants being offered freedom, the mages agree and set to earning their way in the growing city. %0a%0aA year and a half later the envoy from Europe returned. The skepticism in Europe was even greater than that of Northern American Consili. The Envoy returned with stories of at least one duel, little in the way of support, but a chest of potential information for the budding Athenaeum from a sympathetic Mystagogue. The Silver Ladder hope of prestige was crushed, the Arrow desire for service was quelled and the Mysterium, which had fought long and hard with itself, licked its wounds in silence. The Guardians of the Veil, not yet numerous, stayed consistent with business as usual.  The Consilium grew, the work continued and the calendar was watched. Two times might have been happenstance; a third would be a pattern. In the remaining decade and some years the Awakened continued to grow, continued to work.  The secrecy of ''Hattan'' and the skill of his work eluded many of even the brightest minds researching the wonder. Time moved on, and Savannah believed that its overtures had been forgotten.%0a%0a%0a[%25color=#365776%25[[#top| Back to top]]]%0a%0a[[#PT5]]%0a!!Revolution%0a%0a1775, and almost to the day, the Hallows once again appeared. Though, this time, there was more in the air than the excitement of another find. Once again the Hallows had appeared during the storm season, the winds and rains announcing the coming of a severe season were not the only terror that hung unseen in the future. The tensions between the Colonies and the parent were building. Those in Savannah knew there was something on the horizon, the Enchanters and those versed in time studied the signs, the omens, and it was on their words that the Consilium acted. The Acanthi saw the coming conflict, they saw the shrouded horsemen who travelled with every army sense time memorial.  Savannah would first fall, and then stand, its blood would run because of the actions of allies, and not of enemies. The Consilium prepared by harvesting the tass, now a little over 100 pawns, in the week the hallows remained. It was the third time this had happened, and the third time that the hallows had appeared in a different square. There was not enough information to predict which square, which ward of Savannah the hallow would appear in, but the timing was set, 15 years.%0a%0aThe Mysterium went to looking into why 15 years might be significant. The number held no special weight with the Native American tribes, and there was nothing that seemed to tie it to the old world. The researchers continued, and in a daring move, helped fund the addition of another ward, this time with Mysterium and Sleepwalker workers excavating the ground among side the sleeping workforce. The project was a rush, how much could be done before the impending hostilities began. It was a tough time, there were many of the Wise who wished to counsel the Mayor and the Governor, warning them that there would be a time of violence, but to do so would threaten the secrecy of the Awakened. They instead waited, hiding caches of Tass should they be needed during the coming days.%0a%0aThe ward was not finished when the American Revolution began, and within 2 years of the initial blows, Savannah found itself under the guns of the British Army.  3,000 men under the command of Colonel Archibald Campbell, laid siege to the city of Savannah during December of 1778, with Campbell’s army was a small cabal of Awakened, their presence was not a surprise, but their actions were. Campbell routed the Colonial forces and took possession of the city where he then proved to be a cosmopolitan and kind governor. He displayed an urbane method of treatment, allowing people to carry on with their daily lived with little intervention. He did not recruit or try to turn the population back into royal citizens, and would eventually return Savannah to the control of its then Royal Governor, James Wright.%0a%0aCampbell and his army would eventually move north to Aid in the pacification of South Carolina, Charleston especially, leaving a token force behind in Savannah. The city had not fulfilled the prophecy of bloodshed, and the new Cabal of Mages, all of them from England did nothing to change this. The Cabal of the Hidden Seam was a group of Mysterium and Arrows from Newcastle upon Tyne. Four men in all 2 from each order and representing the Moroi and Obrimoi paths, they had heard of the Savannah Envoy to England well after the envoy had returned to America. With time, and some effort, they had studied the information that had been left by the envoy with the Manchester and Edinburgh Consili, and they had decided to come to America to study the wonder. Even though they were part of the “invading” or “occupying” army, they swore an allegiance to the Consilium of Savannah and worked within the British Army to make the occupation a show of force. In all honesty, compared to other American cities, Savannah was spared the worst… for a while.%0a%0aImmediately the new members of the Consili proved that they were not there in name only. The four had copied and transcribed information recorded in the English Athenaeums, storing them in the ghost realm so that they would not be lost to the sea or to an army. They set to work reclaiming and reconstituting the information that they had hidden, adding greatly to the Athenaeum and its existing library. Their work was done in haste, it was only a matter of time before the Americans arrived to reclaim the city. Though the 4 Wise were saddened to learn that they had just missed the Hallows, they were buoyed by the opportunity to study and possibly witness the next advent of ''Hattan’s'' wonder. Stay true to the fifteen year cycle, they would only need to wait for 12 years, 12 years that they had no issue devoting to study. Their exuberance buoyed the Consilium   and all the orders set to creating new Identities for the four awakened so that come the end of hostilities, they could quickly fall into the fold.%0a%0aA year after Savannah fell to the British the American, with French allies, tried to retake the city. These were the nights of blood that the Enchanters saw. The American’s shelled the city, Artillery being used to disrupt the British only served to hammer the citizens and their homes. The assault failed with major casualties for the Americans and French. The Consilium used this time to try and sneak the cabal of British soldiers away from combat and into hiding, listing them among the lost in the combat. Sadly, one of the Arrows did indeed perish, but the three remaining members of the cabal survived and quietly took residence in Savannah as if they had been there all along.%0a%0aSavannah would remain in British hands until 1782 and it would be 8 years until the next advent of the ''Hattan'' Hallows. The Revolutionary war ended, and Savannah rebuilt. The Hallows did indeed return in 1790 and again in 1805, 1820, 1835 and then in 1850. Each year saw the amount of Tass increase, sometimes by just a few pawns, sometimes nearly doubling. A correlation was found, the amount of tass produced by the Hallows was directly proportional to the population. When the population so did the production of Tass, this idea was first thought off in 1820 when an epidemic of Yellow Fever tore through Savannah.   %0a%0a%0a[%25color=#365776%25[[#top| Back to top]]]%0a%0a[[#PT6]]%0a!!Growth%0a%0aSavannah continued to grow along with the rest of the United States. The hard won independence from England gave the new country its various freedoms along with new sets of problems. The first few years were difficult, but slowly a strong nation took shape. From the end of the Revolution and on into the early 1800’s there were times of prosperity, times were the wonder of the still new land amazed its inhabitants. This is not to say there were not problems. A series of wars with the Native Americans; The Creek War of 18131814, the First (181718) and Second (1835184 Seminole War eroded the goodwill that had once existed in Georgia between the settlers and the Native Americans. The War of 1812, again with England had a lasting effect in Georgia, one that would continue to rear its head for years to come.%0a%0aEngland had occupied Georgia easily during the revolution, and there was great fear that England would do so again in the War of 1812. While defenses were erected they were poorly equipped, maintained, and the communication between them was horrendous. The English Navy, then the most powerful navy the world had seen, had little trouble forming a blockade along the Eastern seaboard of the United States, including Savannah. The English made landfall at Cumberland, South of Savannah and North of what is now Jacksonville. Before the army could move north, the treaty of Ghent had been signed, and the War of 1812 was over, again, the effects would be felt for some time.%0a%0aDuring the occupation of Cumberland Island the British forces had conducted raids in Southern Georgia, freeing slaves and inciting rebellion against the state. After the war there was a time of turmoil as Georgians looked to quell these rebellions, and in a manner fit only for that time, “recapture their property.” It was a deplorable time, but slavery was far from being abolished, and the human trafficking would continue through the early 1800’s.  More and more legislation, or a Federal level, came into play regarding slavery, legislation that irritated the Southern States who relied so very heavily on slaves in their agrarian industry. It was a time heading for a boiling point, one that again loomed over the horizon.%0a%0aThe Slavery issue affected the Consilium and the Wise as well, the first African Awakened in Savannah during the 1840’s. Sadly the racism that was rampant in the mundane world was not absent in the Awakened world. While the Savannah Consilium had accepted Native American Awakened, mostly in the form of Thyrsus and Acanthus members, the Awakening of a Slave caused difficulties the Consilium did not foresee.  The Consilium had to adapt, there was no doubt the woman, now called ''Orixa'', was Awakened, but she was still a slave, a piece of property of another, and the very idea shook the foundation of the Consilium. The debate over what to do with ''Orixa'' raged in the Consilium for a month until finally the order head of the Adamantine Arrow, an aged Adamant Sage known as Onager stepped to the fore of the discussion. Citing that ''Orixa'' already knew what it was like to live in constant conflict, and that she Awakened despite adversity and anyone else’s attempt to stop her, that she would have a home in the Adamantine Arrow, and that anyone who wished to contest his acceptance of this newly Awakened  woman was welcome to send their seconds to formally duel him.%0a%0aMany considered Onager a madman with this act, and Consilium records show that he had no less than three formal duels for his actions, three duels that he won in a fashion that his Obrimos nature could call divine intervention. ''Orixa'' joined the Adamantine Arrow, training first under Onager, but as her power and prowess grew, under her newly accepting family. ''Orixa'' was the first, but she was not the last. The Consilium records were not known to record the race of the Awakened in Savannah, but there was mention of color regarding no less than five members by 1850.  %0a%0aBy the 1850’s, the Consilium was more cosmopolitan, at least in their own meetings, while continuing to appear to mundane friends and family as divided on the class distinction caused by race. There were still those who believed that those of color, any color, were inferior, and their attitudes were barely hidden at times, but the will of the Hierarch, and the strength of various members of the Consilium kept these views in check, save for one incident. During the late 1850’s there was a murder in the Consilium, supposedly spurred by an interracial relationship.  Consilium history is thin on evidence of the events, but there was, for the first time in Savannah, an Awakened killed by another Awakened. The names involved were removed from the History, and the event was, quickly covered up.%0a%0a%0a[%25color=#365776%25[[#top| Back to top]]]%0a%0a[[#PT7]]%0a!!Civil War%0a%0a1850 saw another series of ‘’Hattan'' Hallows appear and the haul was the largest amount of Tass collected yet. Savannah had a population of over 15,000, making it the largest city in Southeastern Georgia. The total population of the State was close to 525,000 and would grow in the next 10 years to over 1 million people.  From 1850 to 1860 the Obrimos of Savannah quietly worked on mapping the ley lines of Savannah, a project that had been started and stopped many times before. By 1860 the map was done, and it was strange in a way that surprised no one. The map showed an almost perfect grid aligned with the construction of the wards in downtown Savannah. From there, spoke appeared to head off, the spokes were strong, thicker in some ways, than the lines connecting the grid in downtown Savannah. It was during this time that another aspect of ''Hattan’s'' project was noticed. None of the ley line spokes; which appeared to head to Charleston, Sc. via Hilton Head, to Macon then on to Atlanta, Ga., and another to Columbia, Ga., none of the spokes returned power to Savannah. The Ley Lines appeared to be one way, and one way only, emanating outwards from the city. The Surprise did not end there, but in 1855, with the expansion of Jacksonville Florida, a new spoke appeared leaving the Southern Tip of the City and heading towards the younger Floridian City. The confirmation that the new line did indeed make it all the way to Jacksonville was establish by 1860, the same year that it was confirmed that the other spokes made their ways to the other cities.%0a%0aWhile these surprises were positive moment in the lives of the Wise, there were again the Omens of conflict and war. The argument on races, on color, had reached a fever pitch in the Congress. Threats had been made, if a man by the name of Abraham Lincoln ascended to the Presidency, there would be repercussions. The Wise of Savannah were not perfect, they had started, albeit slowly, to accent the Awakened amongst the slave population, but it was still slow to change. The idea of Slavery was abhorrent to many, yet seemed to be accepted based on the color of one’s skin. The Awakened were changing, unlike the sleepers around them, but they had to be careful not to let it show. It was a difficult time, and was about to get worse. The American Civil War began because of the City of Charleston, and among them the wise of Charleston, fired upon Fort Sumter in the Charleston harbor. Secession began, and Georgia would be the fifth of Eleven States to secede from the Union.%0a%0aAt first the secession appeared to work, the battles, fought mostly in Virginia and Tennessee, were far enough away that one could almost believe there was not fighting going on. The war took its toll, and one year became five, a blockade once again stifled commerce, and the population dwindled as men went off to never return. Then, in 1864, the unthinkable happened. William Tecumseh Sherman took Control of Atlanta Georgia in September of 1864, and breaking with tradition, did not collect his forces and move towards a secure port for provisions. Instead, he began his “March to the Sea,” heading toward the Atlantic. Most of Georgia did not know his true intentions, but the Wise of Savannah did, the end of the march would bring Sherman to Savannah. Sherman waged a war unlike any seen before him, a new concept known as Total War, nothing escaped the sword where he went and the Wise were aware of this.%0a%0aThe Awakened were also aware that there were no few number of Northern Awakened travelling with Sherman’s Army. While some of the Awakened were bound to be from Consili in the North, the Wise in Savannah felt there would also be those who did not follow the ways of the Diamond orders. A sacking was in the making, but the problem, for the wise of Savannah, was that there was nothing left to sack. ''Hattan’s'' Hallows would not appear for another year and they most certainly did not want an occupying army in the city when that happened. By November Sherman was drawing near and something had to be done.%0a%0aIt was two Awakened of the Mysterium, an Obrimos, ''Flare'', and a Moros, ''Locust'', who proposed a solution. Both had studied the wonder left by ''Hattan'' since their acceptance into the Mysterium. ''Flare'' had been one of the many Obrimos who had studied the ley lines and their odd conveyance of energy and ''Locust'' had tried to relearn the ancient prime focused earth-sculpting that ''Hattan'' had mastered. It was their thought that the device left by ''Hattan'' could be “turned off” for a limited amount of time. That the wonder could be diverted so that hallows did not appear, potentially strengthening the ley lines to other cities, but reducing the creation of tass in Savannah, thus hiding the true wonder from an Invading army. With the Hierarch’s blessing they began to work. %0a%0a''Flare'' made notes on everything that he and ''Locust'' did. Rumor has it they forged rods of adamantine imbued with prime, rods said to be “three times the height of a man and as thick around as an arm… .” It took time. They were hurried, but they did not rush. The rods were to act like pins inside a lock, each one set at a different spot, a different depth. The rods, once set in place, would be hidden from mage sight, their threads cut so that no one mage could remove them without knowing where they were placed. The work was complete during the last days of November 1864, Sherman’s army was near the periphery of Savannah. The Awakened of Savannah prepared a delegation to ride out and meet with the approaching Wise. As the delegation left ''Flare'' and ''Locust'' went to work, placing the rods inside the nodes, the pattern kept secret only to be passed along to the Hierarch themselves. %0a%0aThe delegation of Southern awakened was welcomed by their Northern counterparts. Conversation was cordial, concern about their health and the strength of the Consilium seemed to be the first topic of Conversation. There was no mention about ''Hattan’s'' at first, instead, business was done the old way, the, surprisingly, Southern way. At the mention of the wonder it was one of the Northern Awakened who answered the hanging question. The Northern Wise were there to help the Consilium of Savannah protect the wonder. Auguries and precognitions in the North had omens of a great wonder, hidden in the lands of the wayward sleepers that would come under attack from within. Since Savannah was the only city with such a wonder, and since earlier communication had never been responded to, the Consili had drafted men from the Western Consili to try and make it to Savannah.%0a%0aThe Southern Awakened were shocked, they denied having ever received an inquiry or a message regarding this dire event. A panic took over the collected wise and the members from the Savannah Consilium, with an escort from the Northern Wise, returned to Savannah with all haste. There they found that events had transpired worse than they could imagine. ''Locust'' was dead, left murdered in Liberty Square. Of ''Flare'', there was no word. The research that went along with the project, the location of the adamantine rods, everything had been taken or destroyed. The Athenaeum had been attacked, parts of the building smoldered from arcane blasts, the inside held strong, but there was no way those inside could have known what was going on. The deed had been done, there were too many questions, not enough answers.%0a%0aSavannah surrendered to Sherman December of 1864, Sherman, like Campbell before him, was charitable towards the citizens of Savannah, he did as he promised, and showed Mercy, leaving the city intact. Within a Month he was gone, marching into South Carolina on his continued campaign. Among those he left behind were the dozen or so Awakened from the North. With their help, a manhunt began. The trail left by ''Flare'', was obscured, but was not impossible to track. During this search many things came to light. ''Flare'' had been a Seer, originally from the South he was Northern educated, more time and more resources were spent tracking this lone mage down. The next year, 1865, during the appointed month, the Hallows did not appear. The sorrow was equaled in anger, the despair matched with rage. The Consilium of Savannah, as a whole, declared Nemesis on the Awakened Seer known as ''Flare'', and sent this declaration to all surviving established Consili in both the North and the South. The Civil War ended, but a hidden war was just being born.%0a%0a1865 passed, as did 1880, and then 1895, the third cycle was again missed, the Hallows didn’t appear, but there was a conclusion to the story started 31 years prior. ''Flare'' was eventually found in Chicago in 1895. In the 30 years he had been on the lamb, members of the Savannah Consilium had destroyed no less than 15 pylons and disrupted multiple tetrarchies in their pursuit of this one mage. Some of the lost work had been recovered, or copies of the notes made about the project, were occasionally acquired, but ''Flare'' had escaped notice. ''Flare'' had been bartering knowledge for protection and power, but it did nothing to protect him from a wrath of a city. Members of the Savannah Adamantine Arrow cornered ''Flare'' in Rockford Park, Chicago, and forced him to combat. ''Flare'' died in December 1895, taking with him most of the information he had stolen to his grave. That would seem to be sad, but fitting end, to the Seer who had committed such an act against the Consilium of Savannah, but it was not the end. Two Mysterium Moros were with the arrow at ''Flare’s''’ demise, the chained and bound his soul, brought him back the Athenaeum, and proceeded to strip the information from his remaining mind before finally destroying him. It was not one of the better moments for the Mysterium, but it brought closure to a dark Chapter in the history of the city.%0a%0a%0a[%25color=#365776%25[[#top| Back to top]]]%0a%0a[[#PT8]]%0a!!The Free Council%0a%0aThe Reconstruction was hard on the South, especially in Georgia where Sherman had taken life by the throat, shaken it repeatedly and thrown it on the ground. Savannah had escaped the physical violence that Atlanta, Columbia and other cities had experience, but the psychological damage was still there. A way of life had been shattered, and to make the recovery more complex, there were those in the North who took advantage of the situation. Charleston was the premier port on the Eastern seaboard but Savannah still made major contributions in foodstuffs, and of course, cotton.%0a%0aThe loss of the Hallows changed the Consilium in some ways, the Mysterium became focused on recovering the information stolen and destroyed by ''Flare''. Of the five rods sank into the nodes 2 had been found, and they still remained. Somehow the rods had bonded with the nodes, becoming hard to distinguish between the two. There was no idea on how to separate them, and if ''Flare'' did know, not even his ghost gave up that information. The Consilium developed an entire section of their Athenaeum to the study of the wonder. They became withdrawn for some time, the object of their studies had been sullied under their noses and they grew despondent after ''Flare'' was destroyed. The hopes of regaining some of the lost knowledge had buoyed them, and the drop from hope was felt by the entire order. The Silver Ladder worked hard to hold things together, to try and stave off the melancholy caused by rebuilding. The Guardians of the Veil and the Arrows, both having been on war footing for so long, took time to acclimate back into society. It was a difficult era, a time of confusion and questions.%0a%0aOdd that this occurred during the same time as the birth of the Free Council, a time during the refusal, when so many Wise were disillusioned with the old way, looking for something new, something that they could hold on to. The Birth of Free Council was keenly felt in Savannah, many decided that the old ways were not for them, had cost them too much. The apostasy to join this fledgling order hit the Mysterium the hardest, followed closely by the Arrow and even some Ladders and Guardians felt the need to change. In other cities, where there was bloodshed and violence, there was a malaise that was hanging over Savannah, one that took the wind out of sails. The Free Council was not exactly accepted, but it was barely fought. For once apathy successfully stopped violence and bloodshed, but the spiral the Consilium and the Wise were in was not healthy. For close to 40 years the Consilium had been at war, the loss of an enemy was also a loss of identity as they had used resource after resource to chase after ''Flare''. They needed to regroup, and it was the Seers who once again provided them with the opportunity.%0a%0aIt was the most mundane thing really, the Boll Weevil, a form of beetle that seemed unassuming, yet was incredibly destructive, was the enemy. In 1915 small infestations begin to appear in Savannah’s cotton farms. By 1920 it is epidemic proportions. At first the Thyrsus Silver Ladder and the Mysterium sought to contain the Weevil’s using life magic, but it was apparent that this was something more than just an infestation. It was the members of the Free Council, looking for answers outside of nature and the overt, that saw the hands of the Seers of the Throne involved with the Weevil infestation. Once again the Seers were attacking Savannah, trying to destroy its use to the Diamond, now Pentacle orders. The Free Council became the vanguard in the fight not only against the insect infestation, but against the Seers themselves. This dedication to the other Awakened gave rise to the spirits of the Consilium members, once again they had a common purpose, and again they were united. %0a%0aThe Destruction of crops was rampant, but once again Savannah survived. The Consilium had been taxed heavily, but it too survived. The Free Council was accepted, faster than many other Consili had accepted the upstart order. Savannah would continue on.%0a%0aThe ''Hattan'' Hallows did not appear in 1910, nor in 1925 or 1940. By 1940 the Consilium was strong again and the population of Savannah had grown to almost 100,000 people and the Consilium had grown to match. A new conflict was waiting in the wings, one that would take place far away from Savannah, but a conflict that would still have an effect on the city. War spread across Europe, and the Consilium prepared to send aid to its one time parent Consili in England. Since 1860 Savannah had spent more than 40 years in one form of conflict or another. They had experience in survival, in fortitude, and they could feel, even without arcana, the weight that was pressing against Europe. %0a%0a%0a[%25color=#365776%25[[#top| Back to top]]]%0a%0a[[#PT9]]%0a!!The Sacking of the Athenaeum%0a%0aWorld Wars I and II passed, and then there was Korea. The fighting was abroad, Vietnam was beginning to build, and the effect was felt stateside in a variety of ways. There was constant conflict yet none of it at home, at least, nothing like the battlefields in Europe and Asia. A different war was brewing at home, Civil Rights, the age old question of color taken to a national level by the likes of Rosa Parks, Martin Luther King Jr., and Malcolm X rocked the nation with act of civil disobedience and speeches. The nation felt the stamp of a million feet, Georgia did not escape this time of change, nor did Savannah.%0a%0aWhile Atlanta took a spotlight with marches and protests, Savannah quietly persevered. The work done in the 1800’s by the Consilium had done much for equal right among the awakened, and now the mortal population was keeping up. The Consilium used their magic, carefully, to smooth out tensions, to ease the people into a future. Massive works of mind and life, fate and time, were cast around the city, the Consilium did not want Savannah to see another siege, this time from within. By 1940 Savannah’s population was over 50%25 black or of mixed race, one of the largest percentages in America, The Consilium saw the writing on the wall, the transition to a new day was smoother than in other cities, some hatreds and fear could never be defeated, but that was not Savannah’s problem.%0a%0aThe Hallows did not return in 1940, nor did they return in 1955. For a while there was hope, the nodes seemed to grow stronger with the increase in population, the Ley Lines pulsed with an amazing brilliance and Prime users found ways to siphon off some of the residual energy. It was during this time that the modern day Savannah Athenaeum was founded. The building that still houses the Mysterium’s grand library was built, and during one quiet night, over half of its power supply was converted from electricity to energy from a nearby node. It was a grand time, the lore recovered from chasing ''Flare'' added with the nearly 300 years of history and study, made the Savannah Athenaeum one of the great treasures of the Southeast. The subject were many, Ghost and spirits, native American occult, the ''Hattan'' Project, the Weevil wars, Southern Cooking and even a section on the Seers. What made the library special was not the ''Hattan'' information, but a section dedicated entirely to omens, oracles and auguries that had been recorded since the founding of the City. Sometimes these portents were not understood until the event was happen, the predictions were many and varied; often esoteric or hidden in gibberish. Some of the records were never understood, and the members of the Mysterium did not know if that was because the events they describe had not taken place, or the translation was just wrong.%0a%0aDespite the racial tensions, the Consilium was strong. It had weathered many storms, and it had persevered and continued to grow. Not as large as Charleston or Atlanta, and spared the ravage of the Civil War and Sherman’s march, Savannah was a bastion of the Old South. For some time there truly was peace in the city, which made the events in 1962 even more shocking.%0a%0aIn what could only be called a fit of madness an Awakened Mage  studying in the Athenaeum set fire to the room containing the oracles as well as much of the information on ''Hattan’s'' wonder. This was the second time the pages of information were lost, and this time, due to the Awakeneds' knowledge of death, they truly were lost. Members of the Mysterium tried to subdue the Magi; two died in the attempt and one more never regained their sanity. The used of mastery levels of time and fate was awesome to behold, terrifying yet awesome, and the remaining Mystagogue had a choice; save their Athenaeum or fight the magus. They chose to save their works and the Wise, whose name has been lost to time, with threads and fate hiding them away from others, fled. %0a%0aThe magus took nothing with them, at least that is what was thought. There is strong suspicion that “the Eternal Now” or a variant was used. Many conflicting thoughts and memories of the event remained. No two stories seemed to add up, and when the Mysterium looked through its ranks, no one could remember enough to identify the mage who performed this act. What was known was this was not an attack by the Seers of the Throne, this was not a theft. The magus, male or female was never agreed on, vanished, leaving nothing behind and taking nothing, to the knowledge of curators, with them. Instead they left ash and death, there was no vengeance like there was on ''Flare'', to be had. The Mysterium licked its wounds, saved what it could, and put safeguards in play that would never allow this event to happen again.%0a%0a%0a[%25color=#365776%25[[#top| Back to top]]]%0a%0a[[#PT10]]%0a!!Turn of the Century%0a%0aSavannah grew quiet for many years, the city continued to grow, out shadowed by Atlanta as Georgia’s premier city. Atlanta was the capital, the switch had occurred over 100 years ago, and Savannah seemed to move along just a little slows after the transition. By the latter half of the 20th century Savannah had become the fourth largest city behind Atlanta, Augusta and Columbia. If there was a depreciation in prestige it was not felt, Savannah was still the first city of Georgia, and in many ways, its jewel. The Athenaeum rebuilt, the Consilium grew, and the city, in many ways was thriving.%0a%0aSadly, the actions taken by the Consilium in pursuing ''Flare'' after the Civil War had earned it animosity outside of the normal antagonism between the Pentacle and the Seers of the Throne. The early 1980’s saw a refusal war for the city conducted between the Adamantine Arrows and the Guardians of the Veil against the Seers of the Throne. Casualties mounted, the Adamantine Arrow taking the brunt of the damage. By the mid-nineties the Arrow was spent, achieving a hollow victory in holding the city with their order shattered. It was at this time that the future Adamant Sage ''Kreig'' appeared in Savannah. Through sheer force of will he rebuilt and reformed the Arrow. The Guardians had fared better, but their shadow war with the Seers continued. %0a%0aThe final act of the refusal war was the refurbishing of Coastal State Prison, a Federal Correctional institution that the Seers entrenched themselves in. A peace, if you would call it that, was called, though neither side ever completely gave up on the eternal war between the dogmatic factions. The Arrows rebuilt and restructured, ''Kreig’s'' methods were efficient and the Seers retreated behind the walls of bureaucracy.  A watchful peace was still a peace, and the Consilium continued to grow.%0a%0aIn the late nineties ''Titus'' of the Silver Ladder ascended to the Hierarch, and for a while there was a “Golden Age” for the Consilium. After so many struggles, after years of conflict, both mundane and supernal, the city seemed at peace. The enemy was near, but they were known. The works of the Mysterium flourished, the Free Council created changed, the Guardians of the Veil hid the works of the wise from the mundane world, the Adamantine Arrow waited, ready to defend, and the Silver Ladder lead by example. For the moment the Consilium was stable, strong, and in league with one another to make the city a better place for Wise and sleeper alike.%0a%0aThe calm was enjoyed by many, the peace a treat after so many years of struggle and adversity. The hallows had not returned and for a moment that was not a worry. Many dedicated themselves to the study of the ancient wonder, Mysterium mages found able and willing helpers from the other orders in trying to unravel the work of ''Flare''. For some, worry set in, it is always calm before a storm, and while many wished to forget, some would not.%0a%0a%0a[%25color=#365776%25[[#top| Back to top]]]%0a%0a[[#PT11]]%0a!!Modern Nights%0a%0aComing Soon%0a%0a[%25color=#365776%25[[#top| Back to top]]]%0a[[#HistoryEnd]]%0a%0a%0a-----%0a%0a!!The Cast Content%0a'''%25white%25Consilium%25%25'''%0a[[#Consilium]]%0a!The Savannah Consilium%0a"What is a Consilium? That is a good question, the core Mage: the Awakening and the various supplemental books give several different ideas and interpretations of what makes a Consilium. Individually they have their merits, and their flaws. In table-top terms, the Consilium is a collection NPCs that are allies and enemies of the players. The players, often formed into one cabal, are a self-formed bastion for and against the Consilium they exist in. In a chat setting, the Consilium has to be a little different.%0a%0a"The Goal: A chat Consilium has to be dynamic or a vital aspect of the game will wither and die. %0a%0a"The Consilium is the political framework as well as the arena itself. Here the opposite is true compared to the table-top Consilium. The storyteller may be running the hierarch, four Order heads in competition and cahoots with easily twice that number of councilors, heralds and sentinels. Here the players should outnumber the NPCs, so why do so many storytellers try to limit this? %0a%0a"Part of that is control, many storytellers believe that they can control the story and the setting by having a massive number of NPCs that are nebulously defined and exist in the shadows. I disagree, and I won’t do that. The venue will thrive because of player interaction and player action. It is for this reason that the Savannah Consilium will be player driven. It is not a perfect scenario, but it is much better than waiting for an NPC to get back to you on one matter or another. In this venue you will have multiple channels of communication, multiple players with clout and responsibilities that can work for or against you. In this you will not be relying on me as much as you will be role-playing with others, therefor, this is a winning scenario for me."%0a%0a%25block text-align=right%25—HunterV%0a[[#Chistory]]%0a!!Consilium History%0aFive years.%0a%0aFive years and counting since Savannah’s Awakened were forced to accept that sanctum walls and good Southern manners were not as thick and strong as they once believed. Rebuilding is a slow process when the foundation is cracked; sometimes there are too many wounds and triage becomes the business of death, not the first step of healing. Odd, wounds that can’t be healed by time and by mind, by life or any combination of the above, terrify those who have forgotten what it means to feel, to live. %0a%0aHowever, Savannah has a history of surviving, a history of staying strong. Pounded by British and then American guns, surviving the advance of Sherman to the Atlantic, the city has seen blood run through its streets. It was only a matter of time until the blood spilt carried the legacy of Atlantis. The wise are resilient, resourceful, Scions of Ancient legacies and of stubborn Southern pride, they dug in, for five long years they shored up the walls, rebuilt the bastions, and forged anew a pentacle quenched in the lives of the lost. For a while their heads bowed but shoulders remained square, they have rebuilt, they have continued on their supernal paths and the Consilium remain intact. %0a%0aNow is the time of questioning, Is the Consilium strong once more, has it regained its stature and its spine, or is it just a façade covering a rotting core? Even to the Enchanters, the future is cloudy; there are more storms on the horizon. This is the testament of the culling, of the week that saw the world turn against the Consilium, against the wise, against one order in an effort to scatter its members in the dust. Too many had been safe for too long, something was ripe for change and everyone knew it.  The air was heavier, the storm season approached, the population of awakened began to swell, everyone saw the signs before them, they saw them and they ignored them. %0a%0aNothing is more complete than denial, nothing makes a man or woman blind like the idealism they wish to see around them. That denial brought death and now memory is compounded by guilt. Everyone who remains is to blame, but who is accountable, no one knows. Five years have passed, five years of healing, of change. The scars are still raw, five years is a blink of an eye to some. The Slow mind numbing day-to-day routine doesn’t get rid of the itch, the constant reminder of failure make even the purest water taste bitter.%0a%0aSavannah’s Consilium exists like it once did and yet it is changed like never before. ''Siafu'', a Guardian of the Veil, holds the position of Hierarch. This was not a position attained  from a mad grab for power or devious machinations complete with shady deals and hidden promises. The Guardians, the two that remain from the events five years ago, found ''Siafu'' elevated to the role of Hierarch at the suggestion of ''Heron'' of the Free Council. ''Aislin'' of the Mysterium, in her own king-making bid to control the Mysterium, supported ''Heron'' even as she laid the damning, though controversial proof, at the feet of ''Titus'', the previous Hierarch and order head of the Silver Ladder. ''Titus'' was driven from the city, the Silver Ladder was leaderless and collapsed under its own weight on inactivity. The Guardian’s had been pummeled, few of their number remained. The Mysterium saw a change of leadership and an internal cleaning of house, its number was never certain, they remained detached from the Consilium following the rise of ''Siafu''. It was the Arrow that remained, hands still dripping with the blood of the Consilium’s enemies at the ready. it was ''Krieg'' and his warriors who held the line as ''Heron'' moved to solidify the Consilium during this turbulent time. The cost for that holding action has never been acknowledged thought rumors of soulstones, artifact, and debts has made it through more than one shrouded hallway.  %0a[[#Chistoryend]]%0a!!Consilium Hierarchy%0a%0a||border=0 %0a|| [[Players.MageHierarchy#Hierarch|Hierarch]] ||%0a|| | ||%0a|| [[Players.MageHierarchy#OrderHeads|Heads of the Orders]] ||%0a|| | ||%0a|| [[Players.MageHierarchy#Councilor|councilors (Heads of the cabals)]] ||%0a|| | | | || %0a|| [[Players.MageHierarchy#Factotum|Factotums]] [[Players.MageHierarchy#Herald|Heralds]] [[Players.MageHierarchy#Sentinel|Sentinels]] || %0a|| | | | || %0a|| Mages in cabals ||%0a|| | ||%0a|| Unaligned Pentacle Mages (Solitaires) ||%0a|| Apostates and Sleepwalkers ||%0a[[#ConsiliumEnd]]%0a%0a%0a'''%25white%25Lex Magica%25%25'''%0a[[#LexMagica]]%0a!The Lex Magica%0a*[[#Lex-1|Preamble]]%0a*[[#Lex-2|The Savannah Charter]]%0a*[[#Lex-3|Rights of the Awakened]]%0a*[[#Lex-4|Roles of the Awakened]]%0a*[[#Lex-5|The Great Rights]]%0a*[[#Lex-6|The Common Precepts]]%0a*[[#Lex-7|The Right to Trial]]%0a*[[#Lex-8|Punishments]]%0a%0a[[#Lex-1]]%0a!!Preamble%0a%0aWe have arrived at the crossroads of the future, the past having paved our way to this present. Our steps are challenged by the Abyss, by enemies seen and unseen, by our own desires and our mortal flaws. We are Awakened, we persevere despite adversity; we are resilient, strong in mind and body, fortified with soul and will. Now we take the next step, we look to the future by founding a Consilium, a collection of like-minded Wise in the tradition of lost Atlantis.%0a%0aNow, as we establish ourselves, we follow in the traditions of those who came before us, paying respect to the methods and the works of our ancestors by path, by order and by blood. We establish that the city known as Savannah, and a protectorate of land around it, will be under the jurisdiction of the wise who reside here. Bordered by the Savannah River to our North and the Ogeechee River to the South, from the mighty Atlantic to our East to the area known as Skinner’s Bay to our West we now enact the Lex Magica of  the Consilium of Savannah Georgia, in this year 1742. Long may the watchtowers guide our steps.%0a%0a[--%25color=#365776%25[[#top| Back to top]]--]%0a%0a%0a[[#Lex-2]]%0a!!The Savannah Charter%0a%0aMany roles are taken in the course of a mundane life, even more so upon Awakening. The titles we carry are our positions in society, both mundane and arcane. They are the badges of service that we wear, they denote the work we must perform for our society to flourish. The Consilium of Savannah will be conducted under the beneficial guidance of a Hierarch drawn from  any of the Diamond Orders (Changed to Pentacle Orders with the creation of the Free Council.) The Hierarch shall rise by merit, and not simple mastery, to lead the Wise in Savannah. The Hierarch will select a provost to aid them, to stand with them, and occasionally for them. Heralds and Sentinels will be drawn from the orders as needed, no order will have more than one of each, Herald or Sentinel, at one time. The Council of the Wise shall be comprised of the leaders of cabals within the city and the outlying protectorate of Savannah. Solitaires, will be protected, under the Lex and Apostasy will be discouraged without stigmata. Let all wise who follow the Lex exist under its Aegis. %0a%0a[--%25color=#365776%25[[#top| Back to top]]--]%0a%0a%0a[[#Lex-3]]%0a!!Rights of the Awakened%0a%0a!!!Obligations of the Wise to the Consilium of Savannah%0a*All Awakened in the Savannah Consilium and its surrounding protectorate agree to the binding laws of the Lex Magica. The agreement to these honored laws will, in turn, protect the Wise from undue persecution, offering them representation and when accused, a voice when questioning and an Aegis from enemies of the Wise. Rejecting the Lex is rejecting its protection.%0a%0a*All Awakened agree to honor the Great Rights of other Awakened as proscribed by the Lex Magica.%0a%0a*All Awakened agree to keep the secrets of the Pentacle safe from its enemies, those named or those yet unnamed.%0a%0a*All Awakened will protect the Veil, the secrets of the wise will not be shared lightly. Our existence is not to be shared with others.%0a%0a*In times of war, in times of need, the Consilium can call upon the Awakened of Savannah to defend the city, the Consilium and and the wise from assault. This call to arms is a service to all the Awakened and should be considered a great honor to perform. Those who refuse to serve then refuse the Consilium’s protection during these troubled times.%0a%0a*The Awakened of Savannah may be called to testify, to provide witness for defense or prosecution of a trial. Cooperation is to be expected, all Awakened must acquit themselves to the best of their ability.  Refusal to do so is a disregarding of the responsibility of being among the Wise.%0a%0a*An Awakened may be required to provide a tithe of tass to the Consilium. This payment of tass could be for recognition and acceptance into the Consilium, for the establishment of territory as a solitaire or as a cabal, or could be required in the form of payment for a debt. Refusal to do so is a disregard of the responsibility of being among the Wise and standing within the Consilium could be affected by the unwillingness to contribute.%0a%0a%0a!!!Obligations of the Consilium to the Wise of Savannah%0a%0a*Representatives, Councilor or provost, of the established cabals of the Consilim shall meet monthly to discuss policy, ratify laws, make rulings in regards to the Lex Magica, mediate disputes between constituents, hear appeals, and levy punishments against offenders of the Lex.%0a%0a*During this time, the representative Councilors will recognize new Magi in the city, approve of new cabals and hear requests for territory within the city and the Protectorate. Also during this time, those who have served the Consilium will be recognized for their service.%0a%0a*The representatives of the cabals shall work with expediency. If a petitioning Wise has to wait more than a full season for an official response and ruling on their concern, the Council is expected to rule in the constituent’s favor.%0a%0a*The Consilium shall not move against an Awakened accused of a crime without a trial. The Council of cabals will provide the most neutral setting, with counsel for defense as well as counsel for the prosecution. There will be parity and equality, the innocence of the accused will exist, their wrongdoing must be proven.%0a%0a*The Consilium shall protect the Wise from unjust persecution. Any Wise in good standing may appeal to the Consilium at any time to appeal an invocation of the Great Right of Nemesis as being unjust and request intervention.%0a%0a*The Consilium shall protect its constituents from external threats. While the Consilium does not possess a standing army, it is expected to maintain healthy relations with the Pentacle Order heads and keep them appraised of all known threats, and if need be raise needed forces to repel attacks against the Consilium body.%0a%0a*The Consilium, like the individuals who are its body,  shall honor the Great Rights as laid out below in the Lex Magica.%0a%0a[--%25color=#365776%25[[#top| Back to top]]--]%0a%0a%0a[[#Lex-4]]%0a!!Positions held by Player Characters%0a!!!Councilors%0a:Requirements:%0a*The Councilor position is any head of a cabal that is recognized as being a member of the Consilium.%0a*The cabal must have a minimum of three mages and be located in the city or the immediate area around the city.%0a%0a:Status:%0aThe Councilor will be give Consilium status 3 upon being recognized by the existing Council. %0a*If a Councilor steps down in good standing they will get to keep 1 of the Consilium status dots for free. %0a*If they are censured of forced out due to circumstances then they will lose all of these free dots.%0a%0a:Duties and Powers:Each Councilor has a single vote on all matters brought before the Consilium. This body will approve the amending of the Lex and are responsible for the day to day activities of the Consilium. This is the group that will approve territory, resolve minor disputes of territory, they will adjudicate public and personal offenses, decide on methods of protecting of sleepwalkers and so on. %0a%0aThey are not order heads, they do not dictate order policy. %0a%0aSome of the powers of the Council are define as:%0a%0a1) The passing of all amendments to the Lex that are crafted by the Factotums with a majority vote.%0a%0a2) In the event that a Sentinel position becomes vacant due to loss, retirement or censure, the Council will vote in the next Sentinel to that position. The position is order specific, they cannot vote in 2 of any one order, instead each order must be represented. %0a%0a3) If a Sentinel or Herald is censured then the Council appoints the appropriate time that the position must remain vacant. Time will be no greater than three months unless the crime is unspeakably heinous.%0a%0a4) The Council has the right to call a vote of no confidence against an order head. If this happens the Council can remove an order head from their position due to abuse of power or a blatant breaking of the Lex Magica. This is a dangerous precedent and can only be accomplished with a unanimous Council vote.%0a%0a5) The Council can censure other Council members though this does not remove them from their position has the head of their cabal. It does however strip them of Councilor status. If this happens then the Council can then also reduce the territory claimed by said cabal within reason. This has to happen with a majority vote. Examples of the reasons a vote may be called include willfully ignoring Council orders, breaking the Lex Magica, ignoring the positions of Herald, Sentinel or Order Head, or can be called due to inactivity within the Council itself. %0a%0a6) The Council must recognize the Right of Nemesis before hostilities begin.%0a%0a:Expectations:%0aEach time a cabal is formed they then come before the Council to be recognized. It is standard practice to accept the new cabal without question, to afford the new Councilor their position and badge to stand alongside their fellow councilors. It is a serious breach of etiquette to try and deny a new Councilor their status. %0a %0a:Restrictions:A Councilor cannot hold a second office outside of Councilor. There are no combo Councilor/heralds or sentinels. %0a%0a!!!Factotum%0a:Requirements:%0a*Academics 3 (Specialty: Lex Magica)%0a*Investigation 1%0a*Occult 2%0a*Politics 2%0a*Persuasion 2%0a*Mentor 1 (To represent the NPC who will teach the Lex and its interpretations and how to proceed with a case in front of the Consilium)%0a*Patron: a member in their order or another other of at least one status higher than their current status.%0a*Suggested but not required: Mind and Prime arcana%0aNote: The Factotum is traditionally a Silver Ladder position, though it is not unheard of for other Orders to have a member who has passed the Silver Ladder tests.%0a%0a:Status:%0aSilver Ladder characters will automatically gain status 2 as a Factotum, though they may not earn the other title associated with status 2 until later. They will be able to keep their mentor merit if they wish, or they can change the merit to Ally or Contact within the Silver Ladder.%0a%0aThere is no automatic bump in status for non-Silver Ladder  characters who become Factotums. Upon graduation the mentor merit must be changed into either allies or contacts with the Silver Ladder at 1 dot.%0a%0a:Duties and Powers:%0aFor those with the Silver Ladder supplement, you might remember reading about the position of Factotum on page 77.. More than just a lawyer, the Factotum is a specialist who studies, argues, defends and creates amendments to the Lex Magica. There is no one universal Lex, instead each Consili has their own version, though many are similar in a multitude of ways. %0a%0aFactotums will be the only characters who will be able to deliberate and prosecute the Lex should an event come up that there needs to be a “trial” or a ruling on the Lex. Factotums will also have the ability to pen amendments to the Lex, essentially they will be counsel for those who wish to seek change. %0a%0a‘’An example would be that the Free Council has decided a part of the Lex is outdated and they want to see a change. They would go to a Factotum, explain what their idea is, and the Factotum will pen an amendment. Once the amendment meets the needs of the Free Council, the Factotum can put it in front of the councilors and the Heads of the Orders for a vote to see if the amendment will be adopted. They will be able to speak to the Council and the Order heads in the defense of the Amendment.’’%0a%0aIn this, the Factotum is not only the “lawyer” of the Consilium, but they are the representatives that propose change to the law. If an Order does not have a Factotum of their own, then they must seek one out from another order, and there could be some form of payment demanded for services. %0a%0a:Expectations:%0aThe process for any character wishing to become a Factotum is the same no matter what order they originate from. The character must secure a Patron. (This can be done with role-play, with an agreement of a debt or a favor, or it could be politically motivated by plot.) Once the character has a patron they then petition the Silver Ladder to be taken on as a student of the Lex.  Once this happens, the ST and the Player will set up an arrangement on how this will progress. %0a%0aBecoming a Factotum takes more than a month, but how much time it takes is up to the player and their investment. There are ways to condense time studying and an enterprising player will figure them out.%0a%0aWhen the time is ready for the Factotum test(s) it will be a scene run by the storyteller. If the test(s) is/ are not passed the player can choose to take them again in the future (some time will need to pass before that happens) or they can leave the study of the Lex.%0a%0a!!!Herald%0a:Requirements:%0a* Position appointed by Order head%0a* No Herald can hold another position within the Consilium while performing the Herald duties. %0a%0a:Status:%0aHeralds are given Consilium Status 2 for free, the status is tied to the position, should the Herald leave the position in good standing they will keep one dot as a reward. Should they be censured or leave under circumstance then they will lose these free dots.%0a%0a:Duties and Powers:%0aThis position is getting expanded but also defined in its role and its obligation. The Herald position will be the direct voice from the heads of each order to the Consilium, to the councilors of the cabals as well as the unaligned mages within the city. The Heralds operate with the seal and the approval of the order leaders, their word is the words of those on high. Characters will ignore this position at their own risk. %0a%0aHeralds will be able to enter cabal territory without announcement when on Consilium business. Furthermore they will be afforded the rite of hospitality due to their office. This gives them the right to impose for sanctuary. %0a%0aThe Rite of Censure: Heralds will be able to censure councilors of the Consilium (by councilors I mean the heads of cabals,) sentinels, individual mages and potentially the heads of the various orders. This rite of censure is the political ability to “cap” another character’s status. %0a%0a:Expectations:%0aAbuse of powers and duties will be dealt with harshly In Character: These abilities do not give the Herald cart blanche to be rude or demanding. In the case of the Rite of Censure, serious justification will be required. Such abuse could lead to the Herald being censured.%0a%0aIf a Herald is censured, this is a blow to their respective order. Not only will the Herald in question be stripped of their title and their status but the order will lose the position for a number of months agreed upon by the councilors. While the Herald can censure councilors for abusing their power, so can the Herald be removed by the councilors for abuse of their power. During the time a Herald is censured the order has no voice of its own and must operate through other the Heralds from other orders. Needless to say, order agenda may get dicey at this point.%0a%0a!!!Sentinel%0a:Requirements:%0a*None, sentinels are voted into positions by councilors of the Consilium%0a%0a:Status:%0a%0a:Duties and Powers:%0aUnlike the traditional concept of the “enforcer” of the Consilium, here the Sentinel is charged with keeping peace ‘’between’’ the cabals as well as serving as something more akin to a palace guard:%0a*Make Consilium aware of threats and respond to those threats.%0a*With Consilium approval, they may take a mage into custody for breaking the Lex or a Consilium mandate. %0a*Bodyguards of order heads in official Consilium meetings and functions.%0a*Sentinels may enter cabal territory with formal, prior announcement (calling beforehand) of their intention and reason for entering. They do not need the permission of the cabal when on Consilium business. They are expected to be afforded the Rite of Hospitality without question.%0a*Witness to Duel Arcane:  To be recognized by the Council and the Orders as a valid and binding challenge, at least one Sentinel who is not a member of either combatant’s order, or cabal, must be a physical witness to the duel. It is the responsibility of the duelists to agree to a Sentinel and approach the Sentinel to witness the duel. The Sentinel is under no obligation to do so, thus preventing the duel if necessary.%0a*May call a vote of no confidence on a Councilor. The sentinels will need to have a majority vote to enact this vote, and will have to develop and deliver this vote to the Consilium as a whole.%0a%0a:Expectations:%0aThere is no such thing a Sentinel’s “Citizen’s Arrest.” The Sentinel must be charged with a task by the Order heads or councilors of the Consilium. However, when detention is sanctioned by the Consilium, a mage is expected to submit to the Sentinel. This is not considered an admission of guilt.%0aAbuse of power or duties will not be tolerated. Like a Herald, if a Sentinel is censured, it is a blow to the order. The Sentinel will be stripped of their title, their status and the order will lose the position for a number of months agreed upon by the councilors. They can be removed by the councilors for abuse of their power. During this time the order has no guard of its own and must operate through other sentinels and orders. %0a %0a:Restrictions: No Sentinel can also be a Councilor or hold another position within the Consilium while performing the Sentinel duties.  Furthermore, a Sentinel should not be a Banner Warden for a cabal because their duty in Consilium functions will be to the Order Head of their order.%0a[--%25color=#365776%25[[#top| Back to top]]--]%0a%0a%0a[[#Lex-5]]%0a!!The Great Rights%0a%0aThe Consilium recognizes the Great Rights, not only as Rights to be claimed by individual cabals, but as basic rights of all recognized constituent magi and the foundation for the Lex Magica. Any cabal or magi applying for territory is expected to inform the Consilium as to which of these rights they will honor in their territory; failure to do so is grounds for denial of the cabal or magi’s petition for territory. Any right a cabal or individual magi does not extend to others may be freely denied to them by other constituents (if cabal A doesn't honor the Right of Hospitality, cabal B is under no obligation to honor that Right for cabal A if they ask, even if cabal B usually does honor the Right of Hospitality).%0a%0a:The Right of Crossing: Let no borders stop an Awakened with a clear heart.%0aMagi traveling through the territory of another may pass unmolested, provided the traveler refrains from practicing offensive magic in the territory he is passing through. The traveling time is expected to be succinct. Magi following this Right are not expected to guard their entire territory; instead, they are urged to mark 'Safe Paths' through their territory in coordination with the Cartographer. Magi found straying from the Safe Path shall be given a chance to get back on, given the benefit of the doubt that they might be lost. A magi found to be continually straying or found performing hostile magic may expect to be forcibly ejected from the territory and may be subject to a grievance brought before the Consilium by the offended cabal.%0a%0a:The Right of Emeritus: Those who have earned respect must be treated with respect.%0aIndividuals are free to interpret this Right as it suits them within their cabals. When applied towards interactions with the rest of the constituents of the Consilium and the Consilium’s officers, lack of respect given will almost always translate into lack of respect received, and repeated violators of this Right may find their actions a matter of public record. With a simple majority vote the Council may rule that a constituent who has repeatedly been reported for violating the Right of Emeritus may be publicly marked as an exception to the Right of Hospitality for a length of time, usually no longer than three months. No magi would suffer any consequences for denying it to the offender during that length of time.%0a%0a:The Right of Hospitality: Those who request hospitality must be granted it.%0aWhen this Right is invoked by a visitor, a host must provide food and security to the visitor so that she may rest and recuperate. The Right protects a mage for a visit of a week in length. During this time, she is expected to be protected from threats both internal and external, given a roof over her head, and fed at least the bare minimum to keep a human adult alive. Serious, life-threatening wounds are to be treated to the extent that the mage's health is stabilized.%0a%0a:The Right of Nemesis: When vengeance is declared, let none stand in his way.%0aWhen constituent magi clash, no others should interfere unless the feud becomes a direct threat to them, their territories, their sanctums, or Sleepers under their care. The Right of Nemesis must be formally declared to the Warden and Historian in order to be honored by the Consilium. The Council may intercede at their discretion if the conflict grows out of control or if one or both parties appeals to them for arbitration.%0a%0a:The Right of Sanctuary: Protect your home, and let no action cause it harm.%0aConstituents are free to set parameters of behavior for residents and guests within their territories. Violations of these parameters may result in the host revoking the Right of Hospitality. Outright attacks on a constituent's sanctum or hallow may be responded to in kind, and in fact is valid grounds for invoking the Right of Nemesis.%0a%0a[--%25color=#365776%25[[#top| Back to top]]--]%0a%0a[[#Lex-6]]%0a!!The Common Precepts%0a%0aBeyond the Great Rights, the Consilium holds the following to be law, and all constituents bound by it regardless of path or order.%0a%0a!!!Precept of Secrecy%0aDue to the dangers of vulgar magic and disbelief, the existence of magic must be kept secret from those who do not practice it. Divulging these secrets can potentially compromise the security of the rest of the Consilium and Pentacle society at large. Therefore;%0a%0aNo constituent may cast vulgar magic before Sleeper witnesses. Any magi found guilty of violating this law shall be given a Major Reprimand at minimum, subject to stricter punishment with repeat offenses, or if the Sleeper witness manages to pass along what they have seen to others, at which point a Major Penance is recommended.%0a%0aNo constituent may leave evidence of magic having been performed, or leave magic or a miracle as one of the only explanations for a given scenario. For example, if a magi is imprisoned by Sleeper authorities and simply decides to teleport out of their cell in the middle of the night, that magi might be in violation of this law guards were posted in the hallway the entire evening. The recommended punishment for this violation is a Minor Penance.%0a%0aNo constituent may speak of the Mysteries before Sleepers. Doing so has potentially contributed to the creation of witch-hunters and Banishers in the past, and potentially endangers other magi. The recommended punishment for this violation is Imprisonment of a length determined by the High Council.%0a%0aNo constituent may attempt to teach Sleepers the Mysteries. Efforts in this field have proven futile over thousands of years, and it is foolhardy to try. At best, the magi risks the Sleeper's sanity. At worst, the magi risks the lives of other magi. The recommended punishment for this violation is Banishment of a length determined by the High Council.%0a%0aNo Constituent may betray Arcane knowledge to other non-Pentacle supernatural societies. Banishers wish only to annihilate magic and its practitioners. Seers wish only to enslave Sleepers and keep the Mysteries for themselves and their Exarch masters. Other secret societies of magi and stranger things might have other agendas as sinister as the Seers. The recommended punishment for this violation is Banishment of a length determined by the High Council.%0a%0a!!!Precept of Recognition%0aThe Consilium shall record all formal punishments, as well as the actions and circumstances leading to those punishments. These records shall be used as precedent for all future prosecutions of similar crimes. A crime that is recognized might not be punished, but the transgression must still be recorded.%0a%0aAll magi who reside within the Consilium’s claimed borders must abide by the Consilium’s laws.  A magi or cabal who wishes to be recognized as willing to abide by its laws and support the Consilium must present themselves in person to the Council. They shall be asked for a simple declaration of their shadow name, the Path he has walked, a brief description of the journey, and the name of his Order. cabals shall be asked to make these introductions in addition to outlining requested territory. Each Councilor is then permitted to ask one question of the magi. If pressed for time, the Councilors may elect to ask their question of an entire cabal as a collective unit rather than each individual magi. After the formalities are complete, the Council shall vote; a simple majority is all that is required to recognize a magi or a cabal.%0a%0aA magi's sanctum, if recognized by the Council, is generally no longer secret, but its standards at the time of its recognition are accepted as legal.%0a%0a!!!Precept of Protectorate%0aAny recognized territory or sanctum falls under the auspices of the Precept of Protectorate. Constituent magi are not required to divulge the locations of their sanctums. However, hiding such knowledge from the Ruling Council is a rejection of the Council's help with future catastrophes when the constituent's sanctum would normally require assistance.%0a%0aA magi who shares such information may expect a certain degree of protection. During times of emergency, the Ruling Council may offer to help magically fortify constituent sanctums (with the permission of the resident magi).%0a%0aThe Council does not expect a petitioner to approach them for redress every time a trespasser from another Order walks through their neighborhood, nor should a mage take offense every time a mage approaches his door and merely knocks without sending a proper introduction. However, repeated or more grievous violations should be brought before the Consilium.%0a%0aNo constituent may enter the territory or approach the sanctum of another constituent unannounced and without stating their destination and intention. A simple phone call will do. While traversing a constituent's territory via a Safe Path is perfectly acceptable and does not require announcement, any straying from this path requires announcement. The resident constituent may deny the request for any reason. The only exceptions occur with Heralds and Sentinels (see Heralds and Sentinels in the Charter for their powers and limitations in regards to this right). The recommended punishment for this transgression is a Minor Reprimand.%0a%0aNo constituent may, intentionally or not, cause a Sleeper investigation within sight of another mage's sanctum. The potential exists for the mage's sanctum to fall under Sleeper scrutiny, which might create an unacceptable breach of the precept of secrecy. The recommended punishment for this transgression is a Major Reprimand.%0a%0aNo constituent may test the wards or limits of another mage's sanctum. Such behavior almost invariably leads to retaliation, which weakens the fiber and focus of the Protectorate. The recommended punishment for this transgression is a Minor Penance.%0a%0aNo constituent may enter the sanctum of another mage without permission. A mage's sanctum is a home and an assured place of privacy. Mages who violate this precept by intruding into another mage's sanctum can expect to have their capability to intrude to be taken from them. The recommended punishment for this transgression is Incarceration of a length of time determined by the Ruling Council, but not to exceed one month except in the case of repeated violations.%0a%0aNo constituent may initiate a magical attack against another mage's sanctum. If the wronged mage brings it before the Ruling Council for trial, the Ruling Council may levy a punishment as if the mage had intruded upon the sanctum, as well as requiring a Payment of Debt from the guilty party to the petitioner. Alternatively, the wronged mage is within their rights to declare Nemesis, and the Ruling Council may repeal the Precept of Protectorate in regards to the offending magi's own sanctum.%0a%0a!!!Precept of Hubris%0aLegislating morality has historically been shaky ground. When dealing with beings capable of altering reality on a whim, however, we must bind ourselves to commonly agreed upon codes of behavior and agree upon actions that tarnish and dishonor the great power and responsibility we have been given. Therefore;%0a%0aNo constituent shall perform the following against another constituent magi; casting a curse, forcing an unwilling transformation, binding another's soul, magical attacks (unless performed within a sanctioned Duel Arcane), or aiding in spiritual possession. Magi will always disagree on some point or another, and in some cases disagreements can become heated to the point of violence. Using magic as a tool for assault is worthy of censure, as it is irresponsible and does not further the goals of the Pentacle. The recommended punishment for these transgressions is a Minor Reprimand, with punishments for repeated violations subject to the offender’s history and the High Council's discretion.%0a%0aNo constituent shall perform the following against a sleepwalker or sleeper; casting a curse, forcing an unwilling transformation, binding another's soul, magical attacks, or aiding in spiritual possession. Such actions threaten the Precept of Secrecy and should be swiftly stopped. The wounds and scars that result often act as evidence that sorcery is real. Furthermore, sleepers and sleepwalkers, unlike magi, are incapable of defending themselves from most of these assaults. Such tyranny should be left to the servants of the Lie while the Pentacle holds itself to a higher standard. The recommended punishment for these transgressions is a Severe Reprimand, with punishments for repeated violations subject to the offender’s history and the High Council's discretion.%0a%0aNo constituent shall perform the following against another constituent magi; exiling to the Shadow Realm, murder (magical or otherwise), or soul theft. These actions weaken the Protectorate and should not be tolerated. The recommended punishment for these transgressions will be fitting of the crime, with punishments of increasing severity appearing for repeated violations subject to the offender’s history and the High Council's discretion.%0a%0aNo constituent shall perform the following against sleepwalkers or sleepers; exiling to the Shadow Realm, murder (magical or otherwise), or soul theft. If lesser assault against a sleeper is worse than a lesser assault against a magi, then it logically follows that these greater assaults carry a heavier punishment when inflicted upon sleepwalkers and sleepers. The recommended punishment for these transgressions is Incarceration, with punishments for repeated violations subject to the offender’s history and the High Council's discretion.%0a%0aNo constituent shall attempt to force a sleeper or sleepwalker to awaken. In the thousands of years our predecessors were practicing magic, no means of deliberately making contact with a supernal watchtower, even on anothers behalf, has been discovered. If that were the case, the Seers would be a thing of the past. Given the unusually high number of Sleepwalkers in Providence and the fact that some of them have painful or violent reactions to proximate magic, doing things such as repeatedly casting magic around them with the intent to force them to awaken shall be looked upon as magical assault. At best, it will only create an awakened mage that distrusts or even hates the Pentacle. At worst, it will create a dead sleepwalker or a Banisher. The recommended punishment for this transgression is a Severe Reprimand, with punishments for repeated violations subject to the offender’s history and the High Council's discretion.%0a%0a!!!Precept of War%0aOne of the Consilium’s functions is to peacefully resolve conflicts between constituent magi. When the system works, both parties agree with the outcome of the trial. When the system doesn't work, one party may be so discontent with the decision that they decide to take matters into their own hands.%0a%0aA petitioner or a representative of the petitioning cabal must appear before the Council, petitioning them to accept her or her cabal's temporary withdrawal from their system of law. The mage must testify to the actions that the other party has taken against her or her cabal. With a 2/3 majority vote, the Council can decide to formally proceed by invoking the Precept of War. If the Council does not, then the petitioner shall be informed that no matter what she claims, the Council will treat her like any other magi in the city, passing judgment on her actions if anyone files a complaint.%0a%0aIf the Precept of War is invoked, the petitioner shall announce the limits of their aggression. Alternatively, the Council may with a simple majority vote set limits on the level of aggression or dispatch Sentinels to break up the fight if it spins out of control.%0a%0aEven under conditions of war, combatants will still be held to the Precepts of Secrecy.%0a%0aLimits of aggression, or rules of engagement, are as follows:%0a%0a:Street Warfare: The cabal announces that it will attack but not violate the sanctity of its rivals’ sanctum.%0a%0a:Spiritual Warfare: The cabal announces that they intend to use open magic in the Shadow Realm, an invitation to “take the fight outside,” so Sleepers needn’t witness it.%0a%0a:Sanctum Warfare: The cabal confides in the Consilium that it intends to strike back at its rivals’ sanctum. The cabal-members do not expect any redress or compensation for the retaliation that must inevitably follow.%0a%0a:Shadow Warfare: The cabal chooses to confide that they are striking against another supernatural society. They acknowledge that they alone are responsible, and they must personally bear responsibility for the backlash that follows.%0a%0a:The Duel Arcane: The cabal wants to send a champion against their rivals’ champion to conduct single combat, so that greater bloodshed can be prevented.%0a%0a[--%25color=#365776%25[[#top| Back to top]]--]%0a%0a%0a[[#Lex-7]]%0a!!Right to Trial%0a%0aAny recognized magi can bring an accusation of breaking the Lex against another magi. All recognized magi are entitled to a trial. If a Sleeper has been victimized by a mage's actions, any recognized mage who witnessed the crime or has evidence of it may file a grievance against the offender. If a mage has been victimized (and survived), the Consilium requires the victim to appear before the Council to state their grievance. In the event that the victim is deceased or otherwise incapable of giving testimony, the Council may instead hear grievance from a representative of the victim's cabal or order.%0a%0aAfter the initial hearing, the Council must decide whether they must rely on precedents set in the Lex Magica to resolve the issue. In the event there is cause for a trial, or a punishment of any kind, the accused has the right to be defended by a Factotum.  Minor transgressions may only warrant a warning or a formal announcement, but relying upon the Lex also means that the transgression must be logged and recorded according to the Precept of Recognition and then becomes part of the precedents of the Lex. Any further transgressions committed by a guilty mage must be evaluated in light of this transgression.%0a%0aThe hearing shall begin with a dialogue between the Councilors, among the points discussed being whether or not this crime has been punished under the Lex before. A truly unique crime could lead to a trial if the Protectorate has never seen its like, in which case the opening dialogue shall acknowledge that the trial may be proceeding without precedent in order to give everyone involved extra time to search for any precedent or illumination that may affect the outcome of the trial. A simple majority vote of the Ruling Council is all that is needed to begin a trial under the auspices of the Lex.%0a%0aThe Council must then wait at least 24 hours before beginning the trial, but may wait no longer than a month. This gives the Council flexibility to schedule multiple trials over the course of a day if they need to.%0a%0aThe Council must consider the nature of the trial. In cases involving the city's Sentinels or Guardians of the Veil, evidence might need to be kept secret. A 2/3 majority vote is required to keep the proceedings of the trial secret.%0a%0aThe mage who brought the case to trial – the Petitioner – may choose a Factotum to represent him, usually called an Advocate. The Advocate doesn't serve as a lawyer, but if he accepts, he has several responsibilities to the Petitioner. First, witnesses: if the petitioner requires witnesses, the Advocate decides the means by which they are brought before the Council. A simple request should do. Failure to appear before the Consilium may be taken as a rejection of the Consilium, along with its justice and protection. In cases involving serious crimes (anything worthy of a punishment beyond a major penance), Sentinels may be tasked with bringing in witnesses against their will.%0a%0aThe Advocate must then approach the accused and summon them before Consilium. The trial may proceed anyway without the cooperation of the accused. The Accused and/or the Petitioner may appoint a Factotum from their order to speak on their behalf. If the Accused or Petitioner has no suitable Factotum in their order, then they may negotiate with other Pentacle Orders for the use of their Factotum, provided no conflict of interest is created.%0a%0aThe trial, at the discretion of the Council, can require the Petitioner, Accused, and any Factotums to attend. It also might involve some or none of them, depending on whether the proceedings are secret. Regardless, the trial must be held in a venue neutral to both the Petitioner and the Accused, and it is the Council's duty to find such a place.%0a%0aOnce the mages are assembled, the trial shall open with a brief ritual invoking the Lex. The High Council shall act as the jury while the Hierarch acts as the judge. The trial shall be conducted in a manner similar to that of a U.S. Court. The Petitioner and the Accused (or their Factotums) will begin by stating their cases, and then they shall call their witnesses. The opposing side may cross-examine witnesses. Any Councilor is free to use magic to aid in discerning the truth.%0a%0aOnce both the Accused and Petitioner have rested their cases, each Councilor may then have the podium to express their opinion and cite precedents and luminaries that should influence the decision. Once each Councilor has had a chance to state their opinion, all of the High Councilors retire to decide the verdict. A simple majority is required to decide to punish the accused.%0a%0aThe High Council will then return and face the Accused and Petitioner, if present. They will render verdict. At this time, any Councilors may take the podium and suggest suitable punishment. After all Councilors have had their say the Hierarch will pass sentence, as well as determine who will be responsible for enforcing the sentence.%0a%0a[--%25color=#365776%25[[#top| Back to top]]--]%0a%0a%0a[[#Lex-8]]%0a!!Punishments: The 10 Letters of the Tetragrammaton%0a%0aThe degrees of punishment listed below are known among western magi as the 10 Letters of the Tetragrammaton. They are listed here in order of degree of severity.%0a%0aEvery punishment levied shall have a specified duration, known as a stigma. By tradition, a stigma usually corresponds to a natural or mystical phenomena: from dusk till dawn, the phase of the moon or a lunar cycle, and so on. More precise terms for stigmas, such as calendar days, weeks, or months, are also acceptable.%0a%0a:Minor Reprimand:%0aThe Council, through the Historian and the Heralds, issues a formal statement that it frowns upon the actions of the offender. While no further action may be taken at this time, the incident is recorded and archived by the Historian, and may be used as cause for more severe punishment in the event of further or repeat transgressions.%0a%0a:Major Reprimand:%0aThe Council requests that all officers of the Orders and the Consilium limit their assistance to the offender. In some cases, the Councilors may even warn other cabals or mages against helping the criminal.%0a%0a:Payment of Debt:%0aThe offender must pay a debt, usually in the form of a favor, act or deed, to the wronged party. Alternatively, the offender might take up a debt that the wronged party owes to another. The nature of the repayment as well as the timetable for executing repayment is determined by the High Council.%0a%0a:Minor Penance:%0aThe offender must atone for her act by performing a service for the Consilium. The nature of the task is left up to the High Council and should not be a dangerous task; merely laborous.%0a%0a:Major Penance:%0aThe offender must perform a risky or dangerous act for the benefit of the Consilium. The High Council determines the nature of the task and the timetable for completion.%0a%0a:Severe Reprimand:%0aThe Consilium states bluntly that no one (not even initiates) may aid or assist the offending mage, clarifying the duration of the reprimand. Offering assistance merits the same punishment, “tarring” the collaborator “with the same brush.” The mage is then either instructed to meditate in seclusion or abstain from practicing magic. Failure to comply leads to incarceration.%0a%0a:Incarceration:%0aThe offender is magically confined, surrounded by powerful wards that cripple his magical power and guarded by the Warden and his Sentinels. The offender must meditate on his actions. The High Council determines the length of the incarceration and whether or not the incarcerated shall be allowed visitors.%0a%0a:Banishment:%0aThis may sometimes be used as an alternative to incarceration. The offender is given orders to leave the city, sometimes for a specific period of time. If she returns during that time, she faces incarceration or worse. The stigma can include further details of where the mage must go or what she must do before she returns, as dictated by the High Council.%0a%0a:Spiritual Scourging (Confinement or Banishment):This punishment has only been performed ten times since the founding of the current Consilium in the early 1950s. A master of Death can steal an Awakened soul. When carrying out a sentence of spiritual confinement, the master of Death binds a mage’s soul in a protected place for the duration of a stigma before restoring it to its owner. When performing a rite of spiritual banishment, the master sends the soul far away. This may involve hurling it into the Shadow Realm or instructing the Warden or Executor to carry it to another city. Spiritual banishment often results in a quest, as the mage must either chase down the soul herself or find allies who can do so for her.%0a%0a:Spiritual Oblivion:This punishment has only been performed once before in the Consilium’s history; the Hierarch responsible for passing sentence immediately resigned once the business as concluded, along with the Guardian High Councilor and the Executor. The offender’s very soul is destroyed, rendering him incapable of performing magic. Sentencing a mage in this fashion — and actually performing the spiritual execution — is still a punishable offense under the Lex.%0a%0a[--%25color=#365776%25[[#top| Back to top]]--]%0a%0a(:table cellpadding=5:)%0a(:cell bgcolor=#004a80 width=175 align=center:)%25white%25Acknowledgement:%0a(:cell:)A significant amount of this Lex Magica was unrepentantly cribbed from the Lex Magic/Council Charter of Providence with the knowledge and permission of author Nosferajew (2009).%0a(:tableend:)%0a[[#LexMagicaEnd]]%0a%0a%0a'''%25white%25Orders%25%25'''%0a[[#MageOrders]]%0a[[#motop]]%0a!Orders of the Awakened%0a(:table:)%0a(:cellnr:)%0a*[[#AA|The Adamantine Arrow]]%0a**[[#AAS|Setting]]%0a**[[#AAP|Positions]]%0a*[[#FC|The Free Council]]%0a**[[#FCS|Setting]]%0a**[[#FCP|Positions]]%0a*[[#GOV|The Guardians of the Veil]]%0a**[[#GOVS|Setting]]%0a**[[#GOVP|Positions]]%0a(:cell:)%0a*[[#M|The Mysterium]]%0a**[[#MS|Setting]]%0a**[[#MP|Positions]]%0a*[[#SL|The Silver Ladder]]%0a**[[#SLS|Setting]]%0a**[[#SLP|Positions]]%0a(:tableend:)%0a%0a[[#AA]]%0a!!The Adamantine Arrow%0a%25lfloat text-align=center margin-top=5px margin-right=15px margin-bottom=5px margin-left=0px%25http://wantonwicked.gamingsandbox.com/wiki/images/mta/symbols/mta_logo_aa.png%0aIt is easy to see the face of war represented in the Adamantine Arrows. The threats to the Awakened world are numerous. From the Awakened servants of the Exarchs known as the Seers of the Throne to the Banishers, the Adamantine Arrow contests with others whose knowledge of the supernal makes them a most dangerous foe. And there are sleepers, humans who would hunt the Awakened. If this were not enough there are other threats, non-human threats that hunt and haunt the Awakened.  %0a%0aThe Adamantine Arrows is a proud order, taking their roles in the continued survival of the Awakened with a seriousness that is only found in the warrior heroes of the ancient epics.%0aThe soldiers and sailors, athletes and martial artists, politicians and students share common traits: training, discipline, physical and mental conditioning, dedication and strengths in tactics and strategy. And there are the artists and creators, the ones  with the skill to work at the supernal smithies, forging items that some Arrows must use to defeat the greatest of threats. The Adamantine Arrow is not one dimensional, though many cannot see through the wall of warriors to find the apparatus that keeps all militaries running.%0a%0aThe Adamantine Arrow will always be defined by their relationship to conflict. It is central to their existence, their being. The Adamantine Arrow seeks to protect the Awakened and itself as an Order against any threat. There is constant vigilance, a constancy of purpose, and continued acceptance of the challenges place before them. Conflict is eternal, the conflict is life, whether it is mastering a skill or sighting an enemy in the crosshairs of a weapon, the Arrow strive to remain in a constant state of action, life is defined by conflict.%0a%0a>>lrindent frame bgcolor=#ccddee padding=25px%3c%3c%0a!!Phalanxes of the Adamantine Arrow%0aThe First Phalanx: Existence is war%0a->Corollary: Opposition Defines Power%0a->Corollary: Unopposed Power Destroys Itself%0a->Corollary: Power Obeys Strategy%0aThe Second Phalanx: Enlightenment is Honor%0a->Corollary: Promise Others Only What You Would Have Them Promise In Your Place%0a->Corollary: Word and Soul Must Agree%0a->Corollary: Honor is Your True Name%0aThe Third Phalanx: Adaptability is Strength%0a->Corollary: Do Not Have Preferences%0a->Corollary: Die Every Day%0a->Corollary: Magic is Strength%0aThe Fourth Phalanx: The Supernal is the Self%0a->Corollary:  Self- Purification is Essential%0a->Corollary: The Body Is Sacred %0a->Corollary: The Mind, Body and Soul Battle Eternally %0aThe Fifth Phalanx: Service is Mastery%0a->Corollary: Serve Mandates, Not Individuals%0a->Corollary: The Throne is a Warrior’s Prison%0a->Corollary: Revolutions are Creative%0a>>%3c%3c%0a %0a[--%25color=#005826%25[[#motop| Back to top]]--]%0a%0a[[#AA-S]]%0a!!!Adamantine Arrow and the Setting%0a%0a'' "You see it all around us, Consilium after Consilium seeing our service to the Awakened as some form of conscription into a supernal army.

The silver screen has made Quartermain, O’Connell and Carnahan, Croft and Jones names that invoke images of fedora’s and dusty boots, whips and revolvers, temples in jungles, and the ever present threat of traps, animals and the occasional Nazi. This is the glamorous ideal of the Mysterium. %0a%0aThe Mysterium questions, researches and experiments with the arcane, the sublime and the supernal. They seek the mysteries, the answers, and the additional questions that their research provokes. They covet relics of the past; they seek to collect the fragments of a long forgotten time. And, unknown to most orders, what the Mysterium cannot collect they are often times willing to destroy.%0a%0aThe Mysterium, like the other orders, is everything said about it, and nothing. Their secrets are well kept, well hidden. Their practices are steeped in tradition and history.  They are the lore masters and keepers of history, always with an eye to finding hidden truths even as they hide other information for their own safe keeping.%0a%0aThe Mysterium is an order dedicated to the supernal, to the secrets hidden within, and the understanding that knowledge is power, it should be hidden wisely.%0a%0a>>lrindent frame bgcolor=#ccddee padding=25px%3c%3c%0a!!!Thesis of the Mysterium%0a%0aThesis: Knowledge is Power%0aThesis: Knowledge must be preserved%0a->Pancryptia%0a->Academia and the Structure of the Lie%0aThesis: Knowledge has a Price%0a->Amorality%0a->Ordeals%0a->Authority%0aThesis: The Corpus Mysterium%0a->Magic is Alive%0a->The Living History%0a->The Living Mystery%0a->The Mythic Corpus%0a>>%3c%3c%0a%0a[--%25color=#1b9ad0%25[[#mctop| Back to top]]--]%0a%0a[[#MS]]%0a!!!Mysterium Setting%0a%0aIt is not precisely known whether the Mysterium or the Adamantine Arrow first sought out the area no known as Savannah, but it is an institution in Savannah as one of (if not the) longest active member of the Diamond in the area.%0a%0aDuring the trouble five years ago, it was ‘’Aislin'' of the Mysterium who accused and provided evidence against Hierarch ‘‘Titus’’ of the Silver Ladder.  It was also ‘‘Aislin’’ who offered the seat of the Hierarch to the Free Council’s ‘‘Heron’’ instead of to the then hierophant ‘’Mariannas’’. What some believed was soon to be a schism within the Mysterium ended up becoming a cliché when ‘‘Mariannas’’ announced his retirement before subsequently vanishing from Savannah. When ‘‘Heron’’ suggested ‘‘Siafu’’ for the position of Hierarch it was ‘‘Aislin’’ who supported the idea without a pause even as she assumed the now vacant hierophant’s position within the Mysterium. %0a%0aIf there was dissention or grumbling, it was never voiced. The Mysterium did not seem to miss a beat. A war had ended. One Hierarch was sacked and a new, unwilling one installed.  All of this occured within the space of hours, and the Mysterium displayed its ability to play politics. Now, the Mysterium has preferred to let its councilors act in the interest of the Consilium instead of moving as an Order.%0a%0aThe strongest bond the Mysterium has currently is with the Free Council, though that is not saying much. The Free Council spent some time trying to prove their self-stylized manner of an Assembly nee Consilium was correct, only to find out the amount of work it took to balance out the different orders. The Mysterium has never actually said, “We told you so,” but the looks and the occasional comment tell the true story. %0a%0aFor now the Mysterium works on various projects, most of which are hidden away from the prying eyes of other awakened. Some projects are even obfuscated from members within the order, their secret reserved for those who are needed for their abilities. The Mysterium members stay busy, and are often known to develop some impressive frequent flyer miles. And then there is also rumor that there has been a break through on ''Hattan’s'' project, a deciphering of purpose and meaning that will change the face of the awakened landscape.%0a %0a[--%25color=#1b9ad0%25[[#mctop| Back to top]]--]%0a%0a[[#MP]]%0a!!!Positions in the Mysterium%0a%0a:Status 0-1 Neokoros:%0aTranslated to "those who sweep the temple," these are the newest members of the Mysterium.

Some of the members of the Ladder claim a heritage lost in the time since Atlantis, but no Ladder living today can draw a direct pedigree back to the founding families of the ancient city. %0a%0aThe role of the Silver Ladder is that of a leader of people, their role is that of service for the Awakened and the sleeping world. They are the spreaders of vision, of counsel and the scions of those ancients who believed in action. For ages the Silver Ladder has been the backbone of the organization of the pentacle, before the Free Council existed, it was the Ladder who proliferated a vision of the future, the need to evolve, to adapt, and to lead the sleeping world to an Awakened nation. Even now, the members of the Ladder regularly find themselves in the roles of counselors for the wise and the leaders of the Awakened.%0a%0aIt has been the mission of the Silver Ladder to guide the Awakened in their goal to tap into the supernal mysteries. The Silver Ladder fights to remember the past, not to dwell in it, a part that is often overlooked by other orders. The role of a Ladder is not easy, constantly challenged by what some call progress the modern Silver Ladder must be part statesman, part warrior, and part sage. %0a%0aSelf-assurance that their cause is right, that their purpose is just, this is a hallmark of a Silver Ladder.

This is the Silver Ladder of Savannah. Their reign had been longand  had been great. Perhaps too great, and then they paid a price. The decimation of a pentacle member was laid at their feet. Their leader, the leader of the city, of the Consilium was charged with aiding and abetting. Suddenly the losses of another Order became their burden, their Lament as the once bright star of the Magisters was run out of town and the order was left leaderless.%0a%0a That was the hubris, the price of folly and arrogance that was paid by the Silver Ladder. Their faith in ‘‘Titus’’ made them weak, made his brilliance a Panacea for all that would ail the order. Once he was gone, the remaining members of the order were left to fend for themselves.%0a%0aThen there was change. A new Ladder entered the city three years ago: ‘’Alsace’’, Lictor and Factotum of the Silver Ladder. She arrived like acanthi sometimes do, at exactly the right time. She engaged ‘‘Heron’’ openly, arguing the Lex, pointing out that she was not part of the Consilium during the troubles, and that the law was blind to the orders, it was written for all Awakened, all members of the pentacle. %0a%0aWith ‘‘Alsace’’ drawing the attention of the Consilium, primarily the Free Council, to herself, Claviger ‘‘Decimus’’ began the reorganization of the Silver Ladder. Their cryptopolies had been shattered and had dispersed in the two years since ‘‘Titus’’ left. Some saw this as a sign that ‘‘Titus’’ truly was deserving of the accusations against him, other saw it as the scattering of evidence of his innocence. Whatever it was the ladder regrouped, they rebuilt, and now their toes are dug into the ground and they are ready to push back into the Consilium, to retake their place. The Free Council’s dream of assembly didn’t work, the Consilium remains a Consilium, and it is a playing field that the Silver Ladder can finally level, perhaps erasing the stain left on their name.%0a%0aNow is the time that they shake off the rust and the ringing in their ears as they step back into the fight. They will learn how strong they are when the next punch lands.%0a%0a[--%25color=#1b9ad0%25[[#mctop| Back to top]]--]%0a%0a[[#SLP]]%0a!!!Positions in the Silver Ladder%0a%0a:Status 0-1 Acolyte:%0aThe initiated and the new.

Caught between two worlds, knowing one exists, and you are meant to be part of it, even as you are tethered to another. Sleepwalkers are not the butlers and the secretaries of the awakened; they do not exist only to interact with the mundane world. Nor are they blind followers or baby-making machines meant to propagate the species; mages are still human and anyone can awaken. Sleepwalkers, instead, hold an odd place in Awakened society. A position that appears to be part resource, part favored child, the sleepwalkers represent a potential future but remain grounded in the present. For some reason they have pierced the veil, they can see some of the machinations of the Supernal, but for some reason they have not made the journey to their watchtower. Theirs is a life of mystery, mystery and frustration. They see what their potential could be, they are teased with the Supernal gift that has been given to others, but they are only allowed a taste.%0a%0aIt does not help that some Awakened forget their human roots, that some see sleepwalkers as little more than a commodity that must be controlled. These Awakened can be abusive, deceitful, unworthy of taking another as their charge. But what then is a sleepwalker to do? A sleepwalker is sore pressed to combat the power of the awakened in this scenario. To gain sanctuary has a cost, one that sleepwalkers are often times unaware of as they are recruited to one order or another. At the same time, there are those sleepwalkers who parlay their existence into a favored status. They have the fortitude to navigate the murky deeps of the Awakened society without having the inherent responsibilities of a Mage. These sleepwalkers are more than lovers or concubines. They are their own forces to be reckoned with, heads of cryptopolies or labyrinths as they exist both in the Supernal and the mundane worlds.%0a%0aWhatever their role, whatever their purpose, sleepwalkers dance along a fine line. To the enemies of the Pentacle they are tools, just as guilty as those whom they owe their allegiance to.  They are ways that the pentacle can be harmed, damaged if a well-placed sleepwalker could be converted, or killed. Sleepwalkers can rise in status, they can be a member of the Consilium should they be trusted enough. Often times this trust is enforced with arcane means. To an awakened this could be seen as a slight, but for a sleepwalker it could merely be the price needed to belong. Sleepwalkers are the future, or so it would seem, but their worth is not assured. A glib sleepwalker might find that they will never awaken as they are lost to this mundane realm by some unfortunate mundane accident. Sometimes this event is not the callous or intentional act of an enemy, but one of a so called “friend.” %0a%0a!!Sleepwalker Setting%0a%0a%0a[--%25color=#365776%25[[#top| Back to top]]--]%0a[[#SleepwalkersEnd]]%0a%0a[[#Apostates]]%0a!Apostates%0a%0aApostasy, it’s not exactly the right word all the time. There are apostates, be sure of that, there are those who join an order with the glaze of idealism coating their eyes only to have that momentary bliss stripped from them. Those who join and order and then leave the parent order to join another, yes, those are apostates. Or if they leave an order and don’t join another order at all, then the word apostate fits them quite nicely. But there are those who are similar to freshmen in college, the undeclared, the ones who have not sign up or been recruited. Sometimes the orders come after these unaligned like Greek organizations on major campuses. The spiels are a little too heavy, the pitch a little rough and the orders alienate those they are trying to recruit. Some people just feel the need to do their own thing, to find their way without an organization breathing down their neck. There are members of the pentacle who say this is the reason those who strike out on their own are called apostates, because they eschew the order of the pentacle to plumb the supernal on their own. Again, those who chose to follow this path point out, you have to join before you can be kicked out.%0a%0aThe problem with this individualism and the “freedom” associated with being an apostate is that the orders are nominally “in charge.” Not they do not control every square foot of ground, and a city’s reach is often just that, but to make friends with the orders and not be one is a bit more difficult than it sounds. Apostates tend to have a hard time because the Guardian’s like to use them as ways to join other others, as do the Mysterium from time to time. Then there are Bannishers who use the title of apostates, often mention to them by a member of the pentacle, before they strike against their “so-called” new friends. Finally, there are Seers who and completely a peace with using an apostate’s “freedom” for their own machinations. Considering these things, there is a lot less of “I do what I want,” and a lot more of “I can’t do much at all.” The life of an apostate is not easy, but that is the price to pay for the freedom afforded outside of an order.%0a%0aSome apostates can exist within a Consilium, they can become trusted; can even attain positions within the Consilium. This road is difficult; debts are accrued along the way and there is always a bit of suspicion regarding the awakened who exists within the Consilium without belonging to it. Loyalty is an interesting word, and it will be thrown about like slings and arrows. The enterprising apostate learns how to throw it back, carefully though. The apostate who exists in a Consilium does so at the sufferance of others and they must always remember that.%0a!! Apostate Setting%0a %0aApostates are just making it back to the city, there had been a lull, a dead zone, for a while. Specifically, a five year “ban” on Apostates of any kind has just been rescinded, rescinded by a Hierarch who has every motivation to keep it in place.  For the last five year those who wished to leave their orders knuckled down and kept their mouths’ shut, for those not in orders, they were quickly asked to leave the city or sign up with an order. The life of an Apostate was short, sometimes violent, but that has changed… somewhat.%0a%0aFive years ago it was a bit different, Apostates were common enough, but in no great numbers. The city had a balance about it, the orders acting in what many might consider a “Business as Usual” fashion. Then there was a slight increase in those claiming to be Apostates. At first many thought it was just a batch of Guardian trying to test out their infiltration skills, trying to get in with the Apostates and then move on to other cities. One of the problems in being in a small city, especially one as old as Savannah, is that everyone knows someone who knows someone. Using the Apostate cover to get into other orders just didn’t work well, but it did provide a decent cover to move elsewhere. %0a%0aSo the orders felt it was the Guardians, the Guardian of course denied this, and the Apostates just acted like the grown-ups were squabbling by going about their own business. Turns out, the Guardians were telling the truth, and the other orders should have listened. In a week of turmoil, terror and death, the Guardians of the Veil were culled as an order. Many of the so called “apostates” vanished, leaving a handful behind to bear the wrath of a Consilium looking for a scapegoat. Those who remained, they knew nothing, some had been in Savannah for years, quietly following their Supernal path. Now, now the Consilium was looking for revenge, for blood, and for an enemy… Apostates felt the  wrath of an angry people.%0a%0aThat was five years ago, and it is only now that some few apostates are coming back to the city. Theirs is not an easy life, suspicion and distrust steeped in memory color any interactions with those who do not join orders. This is the Old South at its finest, one with a memory that is slow to forget. Oddly enough, the ban the city had on Apostates was lifted by someone who might have had every reason to keep it in place.%0a%0a!!Status%0aThere is no “order” status for an apostate. It is possible to gain status in the Consilium as an apostate, but doing so will take some work. It is possible to play a political game in which you can maneuver yourself into a position like a herald or a sentinel, but doing so will be difficult. The sentinel and the herald represent their respective orders, so when those positions are open, they are often filed with order members. Apostates have no representation in the Consilium unless they become the leader of a cabal, and even then, the Consilium will have to recognize the cabal. Not even the free council will be “encouraged” to recognize an all-apostate cabal. So, be smart, play the game wisely if you are looking to get into politics as an apostate.%0a%0a[--%25color=#365776%25[[#top| Back to top]]--]%0a%0a[[#ApostatesEnd]]%0a%25white%25'''Antagonists'''%0a[[#Antagonists]]%0a!Antagonists%0a%0aThey are out there you know, you are not the only one who has reached the watchtower on the other side. There are those who have made it before you, and those who will come after, and like the adverts say, “Your Mileage may Vary.” Some make the journey across time, space and the abyss, they reach the lands supernal only to have their reality torn into fragments that can never quite be reassembled. This is not the story of Humpty Dumpty, though the analogy might be the same, all the pentacle mages could not put these poor souls back together again. Bannishers are boogey men and women, they are the insane, the broken, the hushed stories told over supernal campfires and whispered when the shadows cross window panes. They are myths, and they are real. Not all awakenings bring the Supernal-self closer to enlightenment. For whatever reasons, the Bannishers cannot make peace with what they are, and they look for ways to eradicate magic from this world. They know that they are part of the problem, but before they go, they seek to erase as many blasphemies from this plane as they can… starting with you.%0a%0aSeers are poster children compared to Bannishers. Where the Bannishers are random, erratic and obscured the Seers are organized, driven, and focused to a fault. When not warring within themselves comparing doctrine sized and whang lengths they are happy to destroy the ideal, and the members of the Pentacle. Conversion, assassination, exploitation and seduction are all tools in the kit of the Seer. They want the world to remain asleep, they do not care to share power, they do not need an awakened nation. They serve very strict masters who do not play well with others, not even among themselves. This is a war that is fought in shadows and on street corners. Between allies and contacts, henchmen and flunkies, the war exists on many levels. Direct confrontation does happen, but that is a vulgar exception to the rule. The Seers would rather snipe away, erode the support and the patience of their target before the strike. Unlike the Bannishers, this war has certain rules, though, they constantly change.%0a%0aThe Abyss is a constant, a dangerous entity in and of itself. It is ever present, every vulgar spell a reminder that it exists, that it grows. But what is worse is that there are creatures in the Abyss that hunger. Some for flesh, other for souls, The denizens of the Abyss are numberless, often nameless, but they are consistent. They want, the need, something that the Abyss is lacking. Whether it is a material form, a soul, or the blood of a victim, Abyssal creatures are not to be trifled with. Negotiation only works for so much, and some creatures cannot communicate to negotiate. %0a%0aDemons, spirits, ghosts, the stuff of myth and legend. Mages are the stuff of myth and legend as well, and they are very real. Spirits and ghost can be fountains of information, they can be allies, they can be enemies. Tread lightly in the realms of the dead, the twilight, the astral planes and other places where only Mages can go. An enemy made elsewhere can follow you home. As for Demons, not all entities come from the Abyss, there are those things that only religions seem to explain, and they are dangerous indeed. %0a%0aThe sleeping world, those who need to awaken. Some sleepwalk, others remain blind. It is easy to make someone hate you, and a mortal with a gun can be as dangerous as a Seer with a spell. Crime of passion, revenge, simple human brutality, humans are as dangerous as any other creature in the world.

This Merit does not measure how much the character knows, nor does it measure a character’s relationship with Awakened Society. %0a!!!Benefits:%0a* Sleepwalker may store a maximum number of Mana points equal to their Somnambulism merit.%0a* Mana may be spent at a rate of 1 point/turn.%0a* Sleepwalkers with higher Somnambulist merit dots receive the benefits of lower merit dots.

They make both the perfect assistants but also weak links in security.%0a%0a!!!Third Eye (••)%0a''The character possesses an instinctive understanding of the occult. However, they may or may not have interacted directly with the supernatural.''%0a%0aSleepwalker can intuit when something has a true mystical significance.%0a*This is not 'Unseen Sense.' It is an intuition rather than a physical reaction to the presence of something and knowing what it is:%0a**Example: A sleepwalker can read ancient texts and recognize that they carry true enlightened meaning, but she may not understand why they're important.%0a%0a!!!Lifting the Veil of Unreason (•••)%0a''The character is truly aware of the supernatural; they have witnessed, experienced it and accept it as real.''%0a*Sleepwalker is no longer susceptible to Disbelief.%0a*Sleepwalker can witness vulgar or improbable magic without increasing chances of paradox.%0a*Mana pool may be used to heal injuries:%0a**Requires meditation for 3 consecutive turns%0a**1 point of mana heals 1 point of damage (starting with right most injury on health bar)%0a%0a!!!Sixth Sense (••••)%0a''The character's mind is now attuned into the supernatural and can perceive active supernatural powers as Mages do.''%0a*As with Unseen Sense (pg. 109, WoD:Core) except that it relates to any and all active supernatural powers.%0a*Sleepwalker can understand Atlantean Runes and High Speech (High Speech merit free)%0a*Sleepwalker can spend Mana to activate contingent powers of Imbued Items or release spells that require Mana as a trigger.%0a%0a!!!Sorcerer's Apprentice (•••••) (2 restricted slots)%0a''Some sleepwalkers hover on the threshold of Awakening, open to the mystical realities of those around them.

Because of the collaborative nature of the process, sanctioning through Forum Private Messages will be difficult.%0a%0aSanctioning typically lasts around a half an hour, but can be longer. There will likely be questions back and forth about experience spends, character history, how these things relate to your character now, and how you anticipate your character interacting with other mages. %0a%0aBased on this discussion, the sanctioning ST may offer additional advice such as contacts, role play hooks, and a background on your order if your character should be in the know.%0a%0a!!Expectations of a Character%0aThere will never be a list of characters that the venue really needs and therefore will be easily sanctioned. Similarly, there is no secret list of characters that absolutely won't be allowed in the venue. The character creation guidelines let you know of any restrictions or banned items so there is no mystery.%0a%0aThe type of character we want you to play is the character that will make you excited to play! Within character creation guidelines, of course. This may mean that you or another player creates an antagonistic character, and that's perfectly fine. The expectation, however, is that "IC is IC". As such, play your character in your style, but respect others playing characters in their style.%0a%0aCaveat: If a concept, for some reason, absolutely will not fit into the venue, be prepared to discuss options that will correct this. Although the character creation guidelines cover several things we know for sure won't fit, we can't discount the possibility that you'll come up with something new. It's the sanctioning STs responsibility to you, the player, and to the venue to ensure that your character is effectively playable.%0a%0a!!Tips for Your Background%0aWhether your background is written in paragraphs, pages or a bullet point outline, the goal is to show interest and thought in your character. Per the character creation guidelines, there is a checklist of topics that are expected to be covered. These tips are to help give you ideas.%0a* Awakening is an important part of your character. How does it define your character's concept? Current state of existence? Your future outlook? How did the Awakening determine your path? Did it effect the Order you joined? Did it effect your goals and beliefs or your nature and demeanor?%0a* The Nimbus should reflect both your Awakening and your path. Develop and define it as it something other players will see and react to. %0a%0a!!Desanctioning and Sanctioning a New Character%0aSanctioning is a lengthy process, and while it is understood that a player may find a character to have grown stale, unplayable, or is simply not as shiny as a new idea, there are some ground rules for dropping one character to create another:%0a*'''You may not desanction a character to escape in game repercussion for their actions.''' If a chain of events has been triggered by your character that negatively effects them, they must be seen through until the end.%0a*'''The new character must be a new character.''' Per the character creation guidelines, you cannot remake a character previously played on Wanton Wicked or another site. You cannot resanction a 4.0 character you previously, purposely desanctioned.%0a*'''Your new character cannot piggyback off of your previous character.''' This means that your new character cannot be known by your previous character (family, friend, etc.), and you cannot rely on relationships forged with your previous character. They must create new relationships on their own.%0a**'''If your new character joins a cabal of which you were previously a member, remember that your new character is unfamiliar with the cabal.''' Entering a cabal with prior knowledge of its activities should raise suspicions IC.%0a*'''Frequent desanction/sanctioning of characters may result in a temporary hold on future sanctions.''' It's understood that sometimes characters just don't fit or you can't get into them, however, frequently desanctioning and sanctioning characters takes time and focus from other players. A temporary hold on sanctioning will be instated in an effort to enforce the time you will hopefully be able to create a character that you'll truly enjoy.  %0a[[#SanctioningEnd]]%0a%0a!!Creation%0a[[#Creation]]%0a!!Mage Character Creation%0a!!!Vitals and Information%0a*'''Name: -Shadowname-''': Must be bracketed with hyphens (-), and are required.

The following describes the expectations of work done cabals.%0a%0aAll cabals will receive their own, members-only forums.%0a%0a[--With acknowledgements to the work of Troy based on his interpretation of Revelations MUX.--]%0a%0a!!!Forming or Joining a Cabal%0a* At least 3 characters are required to create a cabal.%0a**If a mage is joining an existing cabal, any member(s) of the cabal can perform the ritual with him.%0a* Each participant spends 1 point of willpower and 1 point of mana.%0a** Mages join a cabal by performing a lengthy ceremony in a location associated with magic, like a hallow, a mountain peak or a tower, or a caucus building. They prepare symbols corresponding to the cabal's foundation theme and draw Supernal glyphs and swear the oath to one another to create a cabal.%0a**See below for items to consider.%0a* Communal meditation and visions last 16 hours.%0a!!!!Theme%0aDecide your theme, the unifying theme, myth or motif for the cabal and its members. Themes can be founded upon nearly anything, but the cabal’s must hold mystical, spiritual, or symbolic significance for its members.%0a!!!!Purpose%0aThe Purpose is the foundation for the cabal based on a particular set of beliefs. By nature, the Purpose is selective rather than all-encompassing. All participants contribute to the creation of these laws, even if they may not be consciously aware of the role. Purpose is a tool to designate what a cabal is about.%0a%0aThree maximum purposes branching off of this indicate what the cabal’s goals and interests are. They are frequently related to one another, and an offshoot of mutual Path or Order goals.%0a*Above: A goal rooted in the Supernal Realms. A focus or a goal rooted in Awakened society. %0a*Below: A goal pursued in the Fallen World. A ban or an aim directed at Sleepers. %0a*Ascension: A long term, ultimate goal. %0a!!!!Category%0aDetermine the primary ideal uniting a cabal and driving their actions.%0a*Allegiance: The cabal serves an area or a specific entity (spirit, Order, etc.). %0a*Endeavor: The cabal is driven by a shared, epic endeavor. %0a*Principle: The cabal serves an ideology or a philosophy. %0a*Questing: The cabal aims to complete a particular task. %0a!!!!Benefits%0aSpecific benefits are determined by the cabal's Purpose. Benefits are selected at time of cabal creation and cannot be changed. If a new member joins the cabal, her dot for "Above" bonus can apply to an existing or a new Merit.%0a*Above: Each member contributes one dot to a shared cabal Merit pool. Dots may be split among multiple Merits or applied to a single Merit. Common choices include Social merits and Sanctum-related merits, such as Alchemical Lab and Library. %0a*Below: +1 to mundane, non-spellcasting rolls with a selected Skill. %0a*Ascension: Reroll failed dice on Wisdom degeneration checks when adhering to her cabal ethos. Violating the ethos is a Wisdom 3 sin. If it would be a Wisdom 1 or 2 sin, take a -2 penalty to avoid degeneration. %0a*Aura: Scarlet bands for oathbinding are visible on the mage's aura.%0a!!!!Titles of Cabal Members%0a*Farseeker: Scrounger, fixer, this is the person who finds needed resources for the cabal.%0a*Doorwarden: Bouncer, strong arm. Typically the defender of the sanctum or cabal.%0a*Hearthmaster: Tender of the sanctum, also used as the head of the Sanctum or Cabal.%0a*Lorekeeper: Another title used as the head of sanctum, but in charge of keeping the history.%0a*Edgetender: In charge of the mystical resources (tender of the Hallow if you have one.%0a!!!!As Applicable: Rights of Cabal Sanctum%0aRight of Crossing: How you let people in and across your boarders.

It can be used as a way to create a praxis and eventually lead to mastery. This should not be randomly shared as it gives insights into how a mage thinks, acts and creates magic. A mage who shares every CT they make is giving others a chance to fully understand their aura, sympathy to arcana and so on.%0a%0a!!!Sharing Creative Thaumaturgy%0aSharing is still encouraged. A mage who develops a CT and then teaches it to members of their order strengthens the order and can therefore earn status and catch the eye of others (NPC or PC) with clout. It may even be parlayed into building status with the Consilium, as the player supports the pentacle and "the greater good." And it promotes role play.%0a%0a!!!Expectations for Creative Thaumaturgy%0aIt is expected that a mage is developing 1 CT a month in different arcana. This will be used to justify raising arcana and gnosis, and will be the means of building arcane XP.%0a%0a[--%25color=#365776%25[[#top| Back to top]]--]%0a%0a[[#Scrutiny]]%0a!!Scrutiny (pg 277-280, M:tA Core)%0a'''Misconception''': Scrutiny is for any time something neat pops up, and you should respond by rolling dice.\\%0a'''Clarification''': Scrutiny is when you are looking at something specific. You are focusing, and there is a goal in mind.%0a%0a:'''BEFORE''' You Roll:%0a* Mage Sight must be up ''before'' any actions to scrutinize.%0a* In game, you must be descriptive with your post. You are staring, focusing, paying attention to whatever it is you are scrutinizing.%0a%0a>>lrindent frame bgcolor=#eeeeee padding=10px%3c%3c%0a:Scrutinizing a Person:%0a*If you are scrutinizing a person and attempting to be discrete, you must still post, however you can describe your actions to be subtle. %0a*The person you are scrutinizing gets to roll (Wits+Comp) to notice your activity beginning with the first scrutiny roll and all successive rolls.%0a**Any attempts to prevent the scrutinized person (PC or NPC) from rolling results in the person ''automatically'' noticing. There are no "scrutinize out of the corner of my eye" rolls.%0a**Bonus modifiers may apply situationally during a moderated (ST-run) scene.%0a>>%3c%3c%0a%0a* In a Moderated scene, the ST will roll Int+Occult+Modifiers after you identify what you are looking for/at, and for each specific scrutiny. In other words, a single roll will not identify multiple items of scrutiny.%0a%0a!!!Scrutiny: Extended Rolls%0aScrutiny can involve extended rolls, however each roll is made successively, after receiving information from the ST, rather than all at once. The idea is that additional, extended rolls are made when you suspect there is additional information to be uncovered about an item, and if this is the case, new information will be revealed with each roll. Rolling everything at once and getting 30 successes may lead to confusion or frustration if all you've been staring at is a rock.%0a%0a!!!Specific Clarifications: %0a*  Identity: %0a**(1 success) Each resonance or aura is as unique as a fingerprint. If a mage has seen or studied a resonance before and is familiar with it, one success allows him to recognize the subject. He can recognize the resonance of the subject regardless of any sort of physical disguise or transformation, allowing him to detect people in disguise or under the effects of a transformative spell. %0a**(5 successes)The mage can recognize shapeshifters in any of their forms. There are some means of disguising a subject’s resonance (see below). Note that powerful mages have strong auras. Their Gnosis gives others a bonus to notice and scrutinize their resonance. (pg. 75-76, M:tA Core)%0a%0a*Nature:%0a**(1 success) Resonance reveals a subject’s true nature: human or inhuman, mortal or spirit, Sleeper or Awakened. One success is enough to alert the mage that the person is not what he seems to be, but the mage doesn't necessarily know what the subject really is.%0a**(5 success) Allows a mage to determine a subject’s true nature. Among other things, this insight allows the Awakened to recognize each other through resonance, unless concealed in some way. Mages can also pick supernatural beings such as vampires or shapeshifters out of a group of ordinary mortals, although they might not be able to identify what they are, only that they aren't normal.

Status (Consilium) 1 can be purchased. Higher status must be earned in game. It will not be approved with XP alone.%0a*Order Status is earned by forwarding the goals of the order, representing the order and making the order "stronger." Examples: %0a**Voting in a Consilium called vote along order lines at the cost of personal interests. %0a**Creating a CT and sharing it with the order.%0a*Consilium Status is earned in a similar fashion by forwarding the goals of the Consilium. Examples:%0a**Aiding councilors, sentinels, heralds and the like in the performance of their duties.%0a**Defending the Consilium from threats.%0a%0aImportant: Status can be lost by working against the Order or Consilium, however it can also be lost through in game politics.%0a%0a[--%25color=#365776%25[[#top| Back to top]]--]%0a%0a[[#Territory]]%0a!!Territory%0a'''Misconception''': Territory is for Cabals, and just needs to be picked out by the cabal.\\%0a'''Clarification''': Territory can be personal or for a cabal, and it is subject to approval by the Consilium Council.%0a%0aThe Consilium may grant a request in whole or in part, or may deny a request for territory. It is wise to be thoughtful of what lies in the territory and be reasonable in the request. Some cabals with proven service may be offered more territory.%0a%0a!!!Personal Territory%0aRequesting personal territory may require a certain degree of clout (status) to be granted by the Consilium. If granted, there are expectations:%0a*The mage is responsible for their own territory.%0a*The mage will need to 'police' their own territory.%0a*If the territory has a high Seer influence, the mage may be expected to take the war to their door.%0a%0a!!!Territory Restrictions%0a*Territories may not include major arteries of transportation. Major road and waterways are considered free passage.%0a*Major businesses, clubs, gathering points will be considered neutral territory.%0a%0a!!!Interacting with Another's Territory%0a*If a territory crosses the highway, the highway is free passage, but the exits into the territory are protected. %0a*If visiting a major business (ex. City Hall), there is no need to tell the cabal or individual territory holder, however attracting attention to yourself may result in being banned from the territory/access to the business.%0a*Use of major roadways (highways, state roads, main streets, etc.) is considered free passage as long as you are only passing through. Sight-seeing or otherwise exploring a territory requires permission (or hoping you don't get caught.)%0a*If your secret sanctum exists within the boundaries of a requested or existing territory, it is up to you to reveal its presence to discourage or compromise with the one(s) claiming territory.

Savannah is a city that survived a siege in the Revolutionary war, which survived the coming of Sherman in the Civil War, which survived the racial tensions of the Civil Rights movement, and continues to survive today in the worst job market seen since the depression of the 1930’s. Savannah is a city that has persevered, that has survived, and like the city, the awakened of Savannah know what it means to survive.

The story begins with Hattan, an almost mythological figure who predated European presence in the area. Hattan, his disappearance and the rumor of his ascension to archmastery, is only one of the many unanswered secrets of the city. For now there is the enemy beneath the streets, the spiritual dead zone that is the city proper, and the regular appearance of the Seer of the Throne known as “Metric” that has the attention of the Consilium. The orders are restocked, the secrets are slowly coming to light, the question now is, “what will be the price of the answers?” Savannah has a history dipped in the blood of the Wise, painted with liberal strokes, and creating a picture that many will not be willing to see.%0a%3c %0a%3c %25center%25The match makes a graceful arc to the floor\\%0a%3c And time stands still as I turn for the door\\%0a%3c Which explodes in a fireball and throws me to the street\\%0a%3c I hit the ground running with the flames at my feet\\%0a%3c Reaching for the night which recoils from the fire\\%0a%3c The raindrops hiss like a devilish choir\\%0a%3c Dying in the flames with a terrible sound\\%0a%3c Calling all the names of the sleepers all around\\%0a%3c But then in the arms of the night, they lay\\%0a%3c Their dreams sprout wings and fly away\\%0a%3c Out of the houses in a gathering flock\\%0a%3c Swarming overhead as I hurry down the block\\%0a%3c I make my escape with the greatest of ease\\%0a%3c And savor the darkness, drop to my knees\\%0a%3c And the lightless window, my hand on the latch\\%0a%3c I reach in my pocket, and pull out a match\\%0a%3c -MC 900 Foot Jesus- The City Sleeps%25center%25%0a%3c %0a---%0a> Welcome to Savannah, the oldest city in the state of Georgia, the Southern-most port in the original 13 colonies. Welcome to the city that survived a siege in the Revolutionary war, which survived the coming of Sherman in the Civil War, which survived the racial tensions of the Civil Rights movement, and continues to survive today, in the worst job market seen since the depression. A city that has persevered, that has survived, a city whose awakened know only too well on what it means to survive.%0a> %0a> The history of the awakened of Savannah exists well before these modern nights, a story that goes back before settlers arrived in the area. Like the city itself, the awakened history is story of perseverance, of attacks and revenge, of murder and vindication outside of the sleeping realm. A history, recently, dipped in the blood of the Wise, and painted with liberal strokes.%0a> %0a> The Consilium has rebuilt, 5 years ago a pogrom against the Guardians of the Veil left only two members of that order alive inside the city. One now sits as Hierarch, the other, their provost, rebuild the order, slowly, carefully, under the watching eyes of an entire Consilium. The Silver Ladder has licked its wounds, has regrouped, it is growing again, but its member remember with shame that their former leader, the former Hierarch, was accused of aiding those who attacked the Guardians. His impeachment, for lack of a better term, was a blow to the ego and the stability of the ladder, a long burning shame that only now seems to have smoldered and burnt to ash. The Arrow are strong, they are wise, and they are watching, patient, they do not act without compensation, they do not enforce themselves on others, they are aloof, but they are present, unified, and driven. The Free Council leads, they have created an assembly only to find that it was called a Consilium. They are the status quo; they follow the Lex Magica, they make their change using the old methods, some would say they have grown weak, complacent, that it will soon be their turn to fall. The Mysterium counsels, the Mysterium researches, the Mysterium hides. The subject of much of the history, of so many attacks, the Mysterium has closed itself off to many, its membership constantly vetted, check and tested. %0a> %0a> The Consilium is healing, but the wounds still seep beneath the scabs of the past. How much healing has been done? That remains to be seen.%0a

Fifty years ago a member of the Mysterium, whose name has been lost, almost destroyed the Athenaeum from within. In a fit of madness, or rage, the member incinerated volumes of work regarding the –Hattan- Project, supposedly destroyed at least one soul stone, and caused undisclosed amounts of other damage before they were either destroyed or driven off. The damage caused by this rogue mage affected the exterior of the building as well as the interior, not to mention the people who were inside at the time. Since then, the Athenaeum of Savannah has looked like a charred hulk, a derelict structure, a beautiful illusion.%0a>  %0a> The Mysterium of Savannah have a tradition going back to the first Hierophant, a Moros named -Soli-, to lead the order. Since the original, each Hierophant has donated a soulstone to the continued strength and growth of the Athenaeum. Because of this, the Athenaeum is not only the strongest Demense in Savannah, but in Georgia as there are no less than 8 soulstones, potentially as many at 10, in its circle of power.%0a> %0a> The building is three stories, and is only accessible through the area once intended for freight. There are existing wards, bans, and other spells that defend the property. Most of which are focused on keeping sleepers disinterested in some Urban Spelunking and Trespassing. One of the more ingenious spells, a thaumaturgy created by an Obrimos shortly after the building was wired for electricity, causes all the window panes, even those missing, to darken at night.. To most, the building is just an abandoned relic, never quite becoming an eye-sore, never falling apart enough to worry others.%0a> %0a> !!!Consilium Known:%0a> *The Mysterium does allow Consilium member to occasionally consult the Library of the Athenaeum. The Library is open to use for Spirit, natural History, Savannah History, Native American Practices, Geomancy, Ley Energy, Ghosts and Southern Cooking. Those Consilium members who have been inside the Athenaeum say that it feels much smaller inside than the building looks outside, a feeling that takes some getting used to.%0a> *There is a sizable scriptorium on the premises, but these facilities are only open to members of the Mysterium. %0a> *Rumor has it that there is a dueling area, one that has been used outside of the purview of the Sentinels, for what the Mysterium might occasionally refer to as “internal debates.” %0a> *There are monastery like cells for Mysterium members to use when they wish to stay at the Athenaeum, complete with a communal kitchen and small socializing area. %0a> *Other rumors suggest that there is also an area for experimentation, whether alchemical, arcane, or other experiments. One member of the Consilium spoke of seeing what they called “blast doors” when they were researching something in the athenaeum.%0a> [[#AoSend]]%0a> [--%25color=#365776%25[[#top| Back to top]]--]%0a> %0a> [[#BT]]%0a> !!Beautiful Thieves%0a> ''[[Players.MageOrders|The Mysterium]]''\\%0a> %0a> %0a> %25rfloat text-align=center margin-top=5px margin-right=0px margin-bottom=5px margin-left=15px%25http://wantonwicked.gamingsandbox.com/wiki/images/mta/locations/beautifulthieves1.jpg%0a> Half art gallery, half pub, Beautiful Thieves a 3 story art bar located on W.

A casual space that is used, with and without –Aislin- being present; like the Athenaeum, there are some doors that do remained locked. Many have wonder why –Aislin- continued to live, or tend to this location, what with her going blind several years ago.

A medium security prison, the population is strictly male inmates. The Prison itself has a pristine history, actually breaking the mold of housing inmates without rehabilitation, with no incidents of wrong doing or riots. This would seem to be ideal, except that Coastal State is known to be under the auspices of the Seers of the Throne. At least one recognized and named Seer, -Thrush- is an associate warden. There is rumored to be an entire pylon working in the prison, or intermixed with the inmates. %0a> %0a> %25lfloat text-align=center margin-top=5px margin-right=15px margin-bottom=5px margin-left=0px width=150px%25http://wantonwicked.gamingsandbox.com/wiki/images/mta/npcs/thrush.jpg"-Thrush-"%0a> The Savannah Consilium has not poked at the potential hornets’ nest, playing a waiting game to find out the true purpose of the Seers. Attempts to use fate, time and other arcana to divine the purpose have been fruitless as the Seers have taken steps to protect their assets and investment in the facility. Due to –Thrush’s- high profile in the mundane sense, there has been no action against her directly.

The scent of well-worn leather, dry paper and old woods dominate the smell of the first floor. Here is the collection of heirlooms, of accumulated finery arranged in some inscrutable pattern. The owner of Charlatan always seems to be able to find the right gift, right where “she put it,” when customers come a calling. While her ability to find the perfect reassure hidden or stored among all the antiques seems as a surprise to her customers, to the Awakened of Savannah, well, the name of the business says it all. The owner of Charlatan is [[Players.Charity|–Charity-]], Mastigos of the Silver Ladder.%0a> %0a> The set up for Charlatan is a simple, straight forward business arrangement. The 1st floor is the show room carrying everything from hand carved wooden furniture to antique firearms still in working order. Sets of silverware and real crystal chandeliers and mixed in with the occasional baseball card and an original acid etching of “Dark Side of the Moon.” The first floor is business, cluttered it would seem, but pristine, not a speck of dust, not one item out of place.%0a> %0a> %25lfloat text-align=center margin-top=5px margin-right=15px margin-bottom=5px margin-left=0px%25http://wantonwicked.gamingsandbox.com/wiki/images/mta/locations/charlatanantiquesandgifts2.jpg%0a> The basement, of course, is where the creepy curios are kept, because to do anything else would be foolish. The basement is part restoration area, part macabre keepsake display. The items, some of them, are for sale, others are not. Charlatan has been known, on the occasion, to traffic in arcane items; more than one Mysterium member has conducted business on the premises… for a fee of course.%0a> The top floor is living space and meeting space for the Silver Ladder.

The main theater has shown movies, held plays and operas, has been used for benefits, for student productions, has even seen the likes of Gallagher and other comedians. The main hall has been restored and is “quaint” with a seating of just over 1,400. But that is part of the Southern charm, the closeness, the need to know who is around you.%0a> %0a> While mortal work and productions do on, the Free Council holds sway in the “offices” of the theater. The building has 2 levels of basement, and then a sub-basement below that. These areas are off-limits to other awakened, and are only in use during theatrical productions. Even then, those who try and sneak around when the Libertines aren't looking learn the same lesson that Firmin and Andre learn in Paris; there are many secrets in the heart of a theater. %0a> %0a> %25rfloat text-align=center margin-top=5px margin-right=0px margin-bottom=5px margin-left=15px%25http://wantonwicked.gamingsandbox.com/wiki/images/mta/npcs/crier.jpg%0a> -Crier-, Enchantress of the Free Council, is a member of the board that operates the Lucas, she is also an administrator with SCAD, thus tying the two together.

Located on the southern bank of the Savannah, the park is not much more than a green space attached to a parking lot for the Waving Girl and Hutchinson Island ferries. There are pieces of art, metal sculptures on display from SCAD, there is a simple walking path lined by trees and a good view of the Savannah River. Simple, nice, and as mundane as can be, the park fits in with the sedate atmosphere of Savannah. %0a> %0a> Of course, that is because there is no swimming in the Savannah, and the storm drains from the city are usually hidden beneath the pilings of the wharf for the ferries. Good thing they are mostly hidden, otherwise some enterprising soul might try and get into them. Back in the less than pristine history of Savannah, some of those drains were used to smuggle goods, including people, to and from the city. According to myth, least one of the drains will lead its way back to the Pirate’s House, though that has never been confirmed.%0a> %0a> This myth is true, though the way is a bit more convoluted with precautions against flooding. In the event of an emergency, the escape route is still there, waiting. It is rumored that at least one GoV escaped the pogrom against their order by using the old passages, passages that had not been used since Prohibition.%0a> %0a> Currently Morell Park is tended by the Adamantine Arrow.

The businesses are not the important part of the square, the focus is on the park in the center.%0a> %0a> Near the center of the square, not to off from the Oglethorpe Square House, is a Sundial. The sundial faithful follows the shadow created by the sun, a shadow many sleeper has come to look at, well, to see at least once. What people don’t know is that the sundial , if looked at more intently, is accurate… down to the second, in regards to the placement of the sun.

Looking at the sundial with certain magesights will give the Awakened a different picture than a normal sundial might provide. Instead of a shadow telling the time they see a shadow moving backwards, as if counting down. This shadow is not dependent on the sun, in fact, the shadow moves backwards no matter what time of day or night. There is only two problems… no one knows where the shadow began, or where it will end.%0a> %0a> %25lfloat text-align=center margin-top=5px margin-right=15px margin-bottom=5px margin-left=0px%25http://wantonwicked.gamingsandbox.com/wiki/images/mta/locations/oglethorpesquare3.jpg%0a> Because of this irregularity, -Siafu- has gained 24hr access to the nearby Oglethorpe Square House.

There will be something more concrete in the future, but what the Consilium does is use a facility as a meeting place, rarely using the same place twice. Often appearing as an investment group, alumni, boosters or any of a number of organizations, the Consilium stays mobile instead of static. This form of mobile council was a result of the Pogrom against the GoV. The traditional Consilum meeting place of Wormsloe is still used, but sometimes a quick meeting has to happen in the city, and the public buildings SCAD are often times the most spacious and easiest to attain, defend and disappear from without anyone the wiser.%0a> %0a> [--%25color=#365776%25[[#top| Back to top]]--]%0a> %0a> [[#WP]]%0a> !!Wormsloe Plantation (Historic Site)%0a> [[CityBook.MageSettingConsilium|Consilium]]%0a> %0a> %0a> %25lfloat text-align=center margin-top=5px margin-right=15px margin-bottom=5px margin-left=0px%25http://wantonwicked.gamingsandbox.com/wiki/images/mta/locations/wormsloeplantation.jpg%0a> In 1736, Noble Jones obtained a grant for 500 acres (2.0 km2) of land on the Isle of Hope that would form the core of Wormsloe. He constructed a fortified house on the southeastern tip of the island overlooking the Skidaway Narrows, a strategic section of the Skidaway River located along the intracoastal waterway roughly halfway between downtown Savannah and the Atlantic Ocean. The fortified house was part of a network of defensive structures established by James Oglethorpe, founder of Georgia, and early Georgia colonists to protect Savannah from a potential Spanish invasion. Jones subsequently developed Wormsloe into a small plantation, and his descendants built a large mansion at the site which they used as a country residence.The State of Georgia acquired the bulk of the Wormsloe Plantation in 1973 and opened it to the public as a state historic site in 1979.%0a> %0a> !!!The Mansion%0a> %0a> %25rfloat text-align=center margin-top=5px margin-right=0px margin-bottom=5px margin-left=15px%25http://wantonwicked.gamingsandbox.com/wiki/images/mta/locations/wormsloeplantation2.jpg%0a> The Mansion is certainly spacious enough for Savannah’s Consilium, luckily the Consilium does not meet that often. When it does, the staff is reduced, and those who remain are sleepwalkers often tied with the various orders. The bar is often self-serve, and the kitchen is closed after providing finger foods and hors d’oeuvres, cleanup is simple as each member of the Consilium is expected to police themselves, Southern manners and all. The Consilium is careful about its presence in the Mansion; the building is old, a history hidden in the woods. The footsteps that have trod the halls are heavy, and they occasional feeling that ghosts, or spirits, watch the events at hand is not uncommon.%0a> %0a> !!!The Cemetery%0a> %0a> %25rfloat text-align=center margin-top=5px margin-right=0px margin-bottom=5px margin-left=15px%25http://wantonwicked.gamingsandbox.com/wiki/images/mta/locations/wormsloeplantation3.jpg %0a> More often used as a site for marriages and escapes, the Wormsloe Mansion is a relic of a South that predates the Civil War. Hidden away south of Savannah, the Wormsloe house is by the Consilium for an Occasional gathering, one that can host the various and numerous Awakened of the city. Not too far from the main house, nee mansion, is a private cemetery once used by the Jones family. This would not be of note, as many properties had private cemeteries back in the early colonial period, but the boundaries of the cemetery act as a Demense. It has been standing law that the area is left undisturbed in regards to the nature of the Demense, but it has been, at times, been used with the permission of the Hierarch, to practice, research, and experiment with arcana.%0a> %0a> !!!The Dueling House%0a> %0a> %25rfloat text-align=center margin-top=5px margin-right=0px margin-bottom=5px margin-left=15px%25http://wantonwicked.gamingsandbox.com/wiki/images/mta/locations/wormsloeplantation2.jpg %0a> Formal duels, accepted by multiple parties and with the permission of the Sentinels or the Consilium, have used this building on the former plantation’s main grounds for decades. The Dueling House, as it is known among the Awakened, was once a church on the Wormsloe Plantation. Even before its acquisition by the State of Georgia, this building had been the site of duels dating back to the early 20th century. The Consilium of Savannah, with the Plantation tenant’s unknowing permission and then with the state’s, has been using the former church for decades. First as a meeting place, and then as formal location for duels, the small building has seen the rise of the Savannah Consilium from the day its first stone was laid in a foundation. Some say the building is now haunted, no fewer than eight awakened have died fighting in this building.%0a> %0a> http://wantonwicked.gamingsandbox.com/wiki/images/mta/locations/wormsloeplantation4.jpg%0a> %0a> (Source: Wikipedia 14 Aug. 2013)%0a> %0a> [[#SCADend]]	%0a> [--%25color=#365776%25[[#top| Back to top]]--]%0a> %0a> [[#TPH]]%0a> !!The Pirate's House%0a> ''[[Players.MageOrders|Silver Ladder]], [[CityBook.MageSettingConsilium|Consilium]]''\\%0a> ''20 E.

It is thought[by whom?] to be the oldest standing building in the state of Georgia.%0a> %0a> It may not look like much on the outside, but the Pirate’s House has been seen more than a few days, more than a few faces, and has many secrets to tell. The wooden building, with washed out plank siding and simple post and lintel construction has been a mainstay of Savannah, for better or worse, since it first opened its doors in 1753. The Pirate House now is a popular tourist attraction, a pub and restaurant where one can come and get a meal and a drink in good company and the safety of friends.%0a> %0a> It wasn’t always that way.%0a> %0a> %25lfloat text-align=center margin-top=5px margin-right=15px margin-bottom=5px margin-left=0px%25http://wantonwicked.gamingsandbox.com/wiki/images/mta/locations/thepirateshouse2.jpg%0a> Back in the day the Pirate’s House had a different commodity that spirits and foods that it was famous for. Besides beer, food and wenches, the “Pirate House” did a brisk trade in something else; they found new sailors for the ships. Rather than going to all the trouble of convincing people of what a nice life it was at sea (people knew better) they simply kidnapped them.%0a> %0a> This entry, you see, was the dumping point for men who had drank to much, been roofied by the owners of the bar, or just beaten over the head with a cudgel if they were stubborn enough to resist the loaded drinks. The good news, you could never say that the beer was watered down, the bad news, you could say that once you found yourself in the middle of an ocean. Once dumped into the tunnels, like this one, %0a> %0a> %0a> %25lfloat text-align=center margin-top=5px margin-right=15px margin-bottom=5px margin-left=0px%25http://wantonwicked.gamingsandbox.com/wiki/images/mta/locations/thepirateshouse5.jpg%0a> Connect the Pirate’s house to hidden exit points along the Savannah. Unbeknownst to most people walking the street of Savannah, one of those tunnels still exists, connecting The Pirate’s House to Morrell Park, less than a quarter of a mile apart, one of the Ferry landings on the southern bank of the Savannah River. This is unknown to the sleepers, not so much to the Awakened.%0a> %0a> The Pirate house still has some of those rooms open so that customers can see what life could have been like in the part, of course, the Consilium has a different use for those tunnels. One of the basement tunnels has a warded passage, a wall that is solid and innocuous to a sleeper as they suddenly remember it was time to go and have another drink, another cigarette, any normal and mundane reason not to tarry to long beneath the pub. To a sleepwalker, the tunnel itself is… interesting, but in the way that gives an itch to the back of the neck, and a desire to go and get some fresh air. For the Awakened, heading to the tunnel leads them to a dead end with a simple wrought Iron door that is locked. Speaking a simple incantation, an Atlantean word of power, opens the lock on the iron grate and allows the Awakened to travel a bit lower into the belly of Savannah.%0a> %0a> %25lfloat text-align=center margin-top=5px margin-right=15px margin-bottom=5px margin-left=0px%25http://wantonwicked.gamingsandbox.com/wiki/images/mta/locations/thepirateshouse3.jpg%0a> Many have researched the iron gate, and while its metallurgical composition is nothing shocking, the spells cast on the item are impressive. Starting with a mask of normality that is consistently on, when High speech is uttered around the gate there is a triggered Sense consciousness before the gate then opens. As the gate opens it casts a, for lack of a better term, eternal now on any sleepers within the area, in the tunnels or directly about them. At the same time there is a temporary incognito presence and imposter cast on any awakened entering the gate. The combination works that the sleepers don’t see anyone passing through, forgetting the person there a minute ago, perhaps passing them off as a ghost… the building is haunted you know.%0a> %0a> The combination of spells at the iron gate was placed by a master Mastigos in the early 1900’s, back when there was a revitalized interest in the darker histories of Savannah coincided with Prohibition. The basement of the Pirate’s House was first converted into a speak easy, the Awakened just assumed ownership of this portion of the building, making people forget about its existence. The basement has draught beer and a liquor shelf as stocked as the one above them in the main premises. Sadly, there is no kitchen in the basement, so the bar usually has pre-made sandwiches and bar nuts ( yes, the bar nuts are always stale.)%0a> %0a> %25lfloat text-align=center margin-top=5px margin-right=15px margin-bottom=5px margin-left=0px%25http://wantonwicked.gamingsandbox.com/wiki/images/mta/locations/thepirateshouse4.jpg%0a> %0a> Since its inception, the Awakened have always been involved with the Pirate’s House in one way or another. Sometimes as staff, other times as managers and owners, the Awakened presence around the building has seeped into the frame. There is an overall positive vibe about the building, a distraction for those still asleep that allows them to relax, to enjoy. It allows for the Awakened to continue about their business with some freedom, and occasionally get a good buzz while doing it.%0a> %0a> The Pirate’s house has changed hands between orders several times, sometimes used as a bartering chip, other times as a marker on a debt, the current owners of the Pirate House are the Silver Ladder. They manage the location with the understanding that all mages are welcome at the location. The Pirate’s house is one of three known Demenses in Savannah and the surrounding area. %0a> %0a> !!!Rules when at the Pirate’s house:%0a> %0a> !!!!Mundane rules:%0a> *Men -No Shoes, no Shirt, No Service.%0a> *Women – No shirt, free drinks%0a> *No Firearms, knives, weapons, cudgels or anything that might go boom.%0a> *Always pay your tab.%0a> *Do not eat the big white breath mint.%0a> !!!!Supernal Rules:%0a> *Magic that influences another awakened or sleepwalker while in the boundaries of the Pirate’s House is forbidden.

Welcome to the city that survived a siege in the Revolutionary war, which survived the coming of Sherman in the Civil War, which survived the racial tensions of the Civil Rights movement, and continues to survive today, in the worst job market seen since the depression. A city that has persevered, that has survived, a city whose awakened know only too well on what it means to survive.%0a%3c %0a%3c The history of the awakened of Savannah exists well before these modern nights, a story that goes back before settlers arrived in the area. Like the city itself, the awakened history is story of perseverance, of attacks and revenge, of murder and vindication outside of the sleeping realm. A history, recently, dipped in the blood of the Wise, and painted with liberal strokes.%0a%3c %0a%3c The Consilium has rebuilt, 5 years ago a pogrom against the Guardians of the Veil left only two members of that order alive inside the city. One now sits as Hierarch, the other, their provost, rebuild the order, slowly, carefully, under the watching eyes of an entire Consilium. The Silver Ladder has licked its wounds, has regrouped, it is growing again, but its member remember with shame that their former leader, the former Hierarch, was accused of aiding those who attacked the Guardians. His impeachment, for lack of a better term, was a blow to the ego and the stability of the ladder, a long burning shame that only now seems to have smoldered and burnt to ash. The Arrow are strong, they are wise, and they are watching, patient, they do not act without compensation, they do not enforce themselves on others, they are aloof, but they are present, unified, and driven. The Free Council leads, they have created an assembly only to find that it was called a Consilium. They are the status quo; they follow the Lex Magica, they make their change using the old methods, some would say they have grown weak, complacent, that it will soon be their turn to fall. The Mysterium counsels, the Mysterium researches, the Mysterium hides. The subject of much of the history, of so many attacks, the Mysterium has closed itself off to many, its membership constantly vetted, check and tested. %0a%3c %0a%3c The Consilium is healing, but the wounds still seep beneath the scabs of the past. How much healing has been done? That remains to be seen.%0a%3c %0a%3c Mage is a game of modern horror, knowing too much is as dangerous as not knowing enough, sadly, there is no guide to tell you about the perfect mix. Realize with you enter this venue that there is a chance your character may die, your character may lose their mind, or possibly lose their soul. Arcane and Abyssal horrors await you, as do amazing feats of will, of strength and of creation.

It can be used as a way to create a praxis and eventually lead to mastery. This should not be randomly shared as it gives insights into how a mage thinks, acts and creates magic. A mage who shares every CT they make is giving others a chance to fully understand their aura, sympathy to arcana and so on.%0a%3c %0a%3c !!!Sharing Creative Thaumaturgy%0a%3c Sharing is still encouraged. A mage who develops a CT and then teaches it to members of their order strengthens the order and can therefore earn status and catch the eye of others (NPC or PC) with clout. It may even be parlayed into building status with the Consilium, as the player supports the pentacle and "the greater good." And it promotes role play.%0a%3c %0a%3c !!!Expectations for Creative Thaumaturgy%0a%3c It is expected that a mage is developing 1 CT a month in different arcana. This will be used to justify raising arcana and gnosis, and will be the means of building arcane XP.%0a%3c %0a%3c [--%25color=#365776%25[[#top| Back to top]]--]%0a%3c %0a1696,1698c1679,1681%0a%3c '''Misconception''': Scrutiny is for any time something neat pops up, and you should respond by rolling dice.\\%0a%3c '''Clarification''': Scrutiny is when you are looking at something specific.

Status (Consilium) 1 can be purchased. Higher status must be earned in game. It will not be approved with XP alone.%0a%3c *Order Status is earned by forwarding the goals of the order, representing the order and making the order "stronger." Examples: %0a%3c **Voting in a Consilium called vote along order lines at the cost of personal interests. %0a%3c **Creating a CT and sharing it with the order.%0a%3c *Consilium Status is earned in a similar fashion by forwarding the goals of the Consilium. Examples:%0a%3c **Aiding councilors, sentinels, heralds and the like in the performance of their duties.%0a%3c **Defending the Consilium from threats.%0a%3c %0a%3c Important: Status can be lost by working against the Order or Consilium, however it can also be lost through in game politics.%0a%3c %0a%3c [--%25color=#365776%25[[#top| Back to top]]--]%0a%3c %0a%3c [[#Territory]]%0a%3c !!Territory%0a%3c '''Misconception''': Territory is for Cabals, and just needs to be picked out by the cabal.\\%0a%3c '''Clarification''': Territory can be personal or for a cabal, and it is subject to approval by the Consilium Council.%0a%3c %0a%3c The Consilium may grant a request in whole or in part, or may deny a request for territory. It is wise to be thoughtful of what lies in the territory and be reasonable in the request. Some cabals with proven service may be offered more territory.%0a%3c %0a%3c !!!Personal Territory%0a%3c Requesting personal territory may require a certain degree of clout (status) to be granted by the Consilium.

Outside of the orders, mages band together to form working groups with a shared interest. The following describes the expectations of work done cabals.%0a%3c %0a%3c All cabals will receive their own, members-only forums.%0a%3c %0a%3c [--With acknowledgements to the work of Troy based on his interpretation of Revelations MUX.--]%0a%3c %0a%3c !!!Forming or Joining a Cabal%0a%3c * At least 3 characters are required to create a cabal.%0a%3c **If a mage is joining an existing cabal, any member(s) of the cabal can perform the ritual with him.%0a%3c * Each participant spends 1 point of willpower and 1 point of mana.%0a%3c ** Mages join a cabal by performing a lengthy ceremony in a location associated with magic, like a hallow, a mountain peak or a tower, or a caucus building. They prepare symbols corresponding to the cabal's foundation theme and draw Supernal glyphs and swear the oath to one another to create a cabal.%0a%3c **See below for items to consider.%0a%3c * Communal meditation and visions last 16 hours.%0a%3c !!!!Theme%0a%3c Decide your theme, the unifying theme, myth or motif for the cabal and its members. Themes can be founded upon nearly anything, but the cabal’s must hold mystical, spiritual, or symbolic significance for its members.%0a%3c !!!!Purpose%0a%3c The Purpose is the foundation for the cabal based on a particular set of beliefs. By nature, the Purpose is selective rather than all-encompassing. All participants contribute to the creation of these laws, even if they may not be consciously aware of the role. Purpose is a tool to designate what a cabal is about.%0a%3c %0a%3c Three maximum purposes branching off of this indicate what the cabal’s goals and interests are. They are frequently related to one another, and an offshoot of mutual Path or Order goals.%0a%3c *Above: A goal rooted in the Supernal Realms. A focus or a goal rooted in Awakened society. %0a%3c *Below: A goal pursued in the Fallen World. A ban or an aim directed at Sleepers. %0a%3c *Ascension: A long term, ultimate goal. %0a%3c !!!!Category%0a%3c Determine the primary ideal uniting a cabal and driving their actions.%0a%3c *Allegiance: The cabal serves an area or a specific entity (spirit, Order, etc.). %0a%3c *Endeavor: The cabal is driven by a shared, epic endeavor. %0a%3c *Principle: The cabal serves an ideology or a philosophy. %0a%3c *Questing: The cabal aims to complete a particular task. %0a%3c !!!!Benefits%0a%3c Specific benefits are determined by the cabal's Purpose. Benefits are selected at time of cabal creation and cannot be changed. If a new member joins the cabal, her dot for "Above" bonus can apply to an existing or a new Merit.%0a%3c *Above: Each member contributes one dot to a shared cabal Merit pool. Dots may be split among multiple Merits or applied to a single Merit. Common choices include Social merits and Sanctum-related merits, such as Alchemical Lab and Library. %0a%3c *Below: +1 to mundane, non-spellcasting rolls with a selected Skill. %0a%3c *Ascension: Reroll failed dice on Wisdom degeneration checks when adhering to her cabal ethos. Violating the ethos is a Wisdom 3 sin. If it would be a Wisdom 1 or 2 sin, take a -2 penalty to avoid degeneration. %0a%3c *Aura: Scarlet bands for oathbinding are visible on the mage's aura.%0a%3c !!!!Titles of Cabal Members%0a%3c *Farseeker: Scrounger, fixer, this is the person who finds needed resources for the cabal.%0a%3c *Doorwarden: Bouncer, strong arm. Typically the defender of the sanctum or cabal.%0a%3c *Hearthmaster: Tender of the sanctum, also used as the head of the Sanctum or Cabal.%0a%3c *Lorekeeper: Another title used as the head of sanctum, but in charge of keeping the history.%0a%3c *Edgetender: In charge of the mystical resources (tender of the Hallow if you have one.%0a%3c !!!!As Applicable: Rights of Cabal Sanctum%0a%3c Right of Crossing: How you let people in and across your boarders.

When other orders need the use of specific Arrows, then there is a price for their service. While Krieg does not require Arrows who have joined cabals to charge a tithe to their cabal mates, but when specialists are needed there is always a fee. This, in no uncertain terms, makes the Consilium nervous because what ''Krieg'' is doing is not against the Lex in any way, and it would appear that they have no choice but to acquiesce to the way the Order is run. ‘’Krieg’’ has created “fire-teams” that respond to various problems. Starting with the bare minimum of two Arrows, because an Arrow never serves alone, the fire teams operate to support Consilium and Order goals. From this basic unit the Fire Teams can grow in size to up to eight Arrows working in conjunction and often under a First Talon or a brevetted First Talon for an operation. While operational “command” of these units can be under the leadership of another Awakened, strategic and tactical command always resides in the hands of the ranking Arrow or the deal is not agreed to.%0a> %0a962c979,992%0a%3c %0a---%0a> >>lrindent frame bgcolor=#eeeeee%3c%3c%0a> '''Adamantine Arrows and the Guardians of the Veil'''\\%0a> The relationship with the Guardians of the Veil is neutral to oddly friendly; the Order respects the position the Guardians of the Veil, seeing them as survivors in way.

But there are also the teachers, the educators, the historians and those who seek to build on the mistakes of the past to provide for a better future. To some, the only difference between the Free Council and the Silver Ladder is public relations and press coverage. The Free Council do look to the future, often time chafing at the plodding of the Diamond in its slow trek to Ascension.  The Free Council is made up of as many half-truths as any of the other orders. The Free Council is not free, and it is not exactly a Council. Without organization the libertines would have never succeeded in formulating their own order, without sacrifice and adherence to as many mandates and policies as the other order the Order would have crumbled under its own weight. The cogs of progress are lubricated with the ideals of the visionaries, but the pathway to hell is coated in their good intentions.%0a> %0a> To be a Libertine is to understand an internal conflict, to strive for a future set on the ruins of the past. Instead of blind ambition the rose colored glasses of idealism are often the most common possession of many a Libertine’s satchel of useful tools. Belief in the future of all awakened, belief that something better is still to come; these are some of the hallmarks of the Libertines. Derision to those stuck in the past, a jester’s mocking of the king, the conflict of the Free Council and the Atlantean Orders is not a war. There must be someone willing to question the past, someone willing to use it to light the future. When the other orders develop tunnel vision based on myth it is the Free Council’s job to light the fire, to burn away superstition and show what potential awaits the Awakened nation.%0a> %0a> Activist, politician, teacher, conspiracy theorist, anyone can be a member of the Free Council.

In short, he sidestepped direct responsibility to the Consilium and forced a Guardian into a position they didn’t want. An important figurehead has to stay in front of the eyes of the Orders to run the Consilium, and ''Heron'' preferred to run things from behind the scenes. He proved himself to be an astute politician, one capable of leading without needing a title to do it and this act was just the beginning.%0a%3c %0a---%0a> Becoming the norm is a bitch, becoming the institution is even worse. The Free Council in Savannah is in an odd position; they appear to be in charge without having to sit in the big chair. The situation is convoluted to say the least, but it is a truth.%0a> %0a> Five years ago a pogrom against the Guardians of the Veil was laid at the Hierarch’s feet. Titus, a Silver Ladder, was run out of town under accusations of supporting the Abyss, the Seers, and about anyone else the Consilium could blame for the death of so many awakened. The apostate population was culled, even the Free Council wanted blood in those days. Afterwards the Consilium was wrecked, one order was decimated, and another was in shambles. It was at this time that -Heron,- the head of the Assembly in Savannah, was offered the Hierarch’s  position by the ranking members of the Mysterium. The Arrow didn’t want the spot, the Silver Ladder was stained by Titus and the accusations against him and the Guardians were in Shambles. %0a> %0a> In what can only be described as a “dick” move, ‘‘Heron’’ instead suggested that the Guardians would be safest if one of their members was Hierarch. In short, ‘‘Heron’’ sidestepped direct responsibility to the Consilium and forced a Guardian into a position they didn’t want. It was a coup, a Mask was now, in -Heron’s- mind, and impotent figurehead that had to stay in front of the eyes of the Consilium at all order when they had to run the Consilium.  ‘‘Heron’’ proved  himself to be an astute politician, one capable of leading without needing a title to do it and this act was just the beginning.%0a> %0a> In the last five years ‘‘Heron’’ has made sure that there is enough Consilium business to keep the masks weak in physical power. The Silver Ladder, yeah, they are recovering, but it is slow. The Ladder’s pride took the brunt of the damage and ‘‘Heron’’ is sometimes liberal in reminding the Magisters about this.  Following -Heron’s- lead, the Free Council took the opportunity to show the Ladder that living in the past, or what the Libertines see as the past, was not the way to go. %0a> %0a> How did they show the Silver Ladder that the old ways didn’t work, well, they stepped in and operated the Consilium how they thought it should be ran. In doing this they, the Free Council, became the institution; a shift they did not see coming and were, at first, not prepared to adapt to.  The Mysterium was not dabbling in politics, busy with their own pursuits,  and the Arrows were their normal quiet self under the leadership of ‘‘Kreig’’.  Suddenly the Free Council was doing all the leg work in the Consilium, a role that they had to take to prove the old ways were wrong and, initially, they seemed to be up to the task. There was some change, but over the course of the last five years the Libertines find themselves following the old methods, in regards to the Consilium, instead of forging new methods. To some this was lazy, to others it was what was needed. The Free Council seemed to lose some of its vision and there has been talk that ‘‘Heron’’ spends too much time resting on his laurels.%0a> %0a> The current state for the Free Council is the natural state of the Free Council, one of change, a flux caught in the moment right before it sparks. The Free Council has made some change happen, but they have also fallen into old habits. They are not the outcast order, they are not the young upstarts. Here in Savannah they are the institution, not as an Assembly for all Awakened, but as the current backbone of the Consilium. There are perks, the Free Council has been able to keep the Guardians in check, the Silver Ladder cowed and appear to have little in the way of opposition from the Arrows and the Mysterium. The problem, as some see it, is that the Free Council has a lot of what it wants… and no idea what to do with it. ‘‘Heron’’ leads the Free Council, but does not lead the Consilium. The work supporting the Consilium and the Awakened has fallen to the rank and file. %0a> %0a1031,1033c1063,1104%0a%3c [--%25color=#1b9ad0%25[[#motop| Back to top]]--]%0a%3c %0a%3c [[#FCP]]%0a---%0a>  [--%25color=#365776%25[[#top| Back to top]]--]%0a> %0a> [[#FC-OS]]%0a> !!!Free Council Order Status%0a> Forward the goals of the Free Council.

There are easy ways for the common Libertine to rise in some stature, and forwarding the goals and earning Consilium status can be parlayed into order status.. Taking active roles in the Consilium is an easy path for a Libertine, some of these roles can include Councilor or Provost to a cabal, the position of Sentinel or of Herald. Also, for enterprising players the character could learn from another order, taking order specific titles (such as the Silver Ladder Factotum [lawyer of the Lex]) as a way to represent the adaptability of the Free Council as an order.

More than the dream police or the supernal FBI, the Guardians believe, with a religious fervor, that their role is to make a better world. %0a> %0a> While they are not the awakened police, per say, they are similar to an IAD, an Internal Affairs Division. They stop Awakened from affecting the mortal world in supernal manners. Whether the vulgar magic, a particular dislike of Guardians because of their dogmatic beliefs, used by a new Free Councilors, or the abuse of sleepwalkers by a Silver Ladder Cryptopoly, the guardians look to uncover the wrongs committed by the Awakened so that they cannot be repeated. Are the Guardian’s their brothers’ keepers? Yes and no, they sacrifice for the Pentacle because while they believe the Awakened must herald in a new age, Guardians know they cannot lead. So they seek to defend, as best they can in manners that they can, so that those who do lead, lead  justly. Their perception, like any other order, can be skewed based on the leadership of the order. %0a> %0a> If this were not enough to cast a shadow of doubt and insecurity when dealing with the Guardians, then their almost cult-like fanaticism and structure is the proverbial nail in their supernal coffin. The order itself believes in prophecy and in the coming of a new age, an age that they, in their service and their suffering, herald into being. It is during this time that the sins of the Guardians will be judged, will ways equal means, or will all the suffering be for naught as the Guardians are once again considered the Pariah of the Awakened. There is no easy answer, there is no simple truth. The Guardians keep their secrets, hiding their motivations deep and dark, for every truth that is uncovered about the order a half dozen lies are used to swaddle the information until there is nothing left to believe.%0a> %0a> Guardians utilize many tactics that mirror the Seers of the Throne, extensively using mortals, sleepwalkers and sleepers alike. A labyrinth is as complex as a Silver Ladder Cryptopoly and twice and dangerous. Here the cults rise and fall, the sins of a few are dispersed to the many, and sometimes, there is a required payment for these sins. Sometimes, the only thing on the menu is the Kool-Aid and there is no choice but to drink.%0a> %0a>  [--%25color=#365776%25[[#top| Back to top]]--]%0a> %0a> [[#GoV-S]]%0a1094,1105c1138,1189%0a%3c %0a%3c The Guardians of the Veil still exist in Savannah, though there are few survivors who lived through the events of previous years.

She refuses to sit down when the Consilium is convened; so it is hard to say she holds that chair. Even now, with all that has been done, all thrones are false. Her voice echoes when she speaks, addressing the present and the past, part of her still lost in events that happened half a decade ago. She and her lieutenant, ‘’Moraceae’’,  are among the handful that survived the pogrom against the Guardians, the few that remember a week’s worth of terror and loss. Some have fled, no longer willing to live in Savannah, others have retreated, sealing themselves away so that their demons do not affect others.  Then there are those that died as they had lived, as Guardians of the Veil in the war against the Lie and the Abyss.%0a> %0a> ‘‘Siafu’’ never asked to be the Hierarch, no, that was a political machination orchestrated by -Heron. - She knows this, but she does not hold it against -Heron, - he does not realize that sacrifice is needed to protect the awakened, the sleepers, and those caught in between. Free Councilors rarely understand sacrifice without martyrdom; sometimes one just has to act without other’s watching.  ‘‘Siafu’’ understands that, understands sacrifice; this is what Guardians do. ‘‘Siafu’s’’ sacrifice is that she must lead the Consilium, for now, as best she can in a role that any Guardian would normally avoid.

These were not the shadowy figures that existed in the rumors and myths of other Consili, these were active Awakened who worked in and outside of the Consilium. The Guardians were respected, in a way, by the other orders. They followed the Lex, they performed their duties, and for the most part, they worked outside of the city when they were needed. Their reputation followed them, of course, but they did their best not to live up to the accusations normally reserved for Guardians. %0a> %0a> Now Savannah has a smaller population of Guardians than before, and their public mask has been forced because of the other orders. The Guardians, with ‘‘Siafu’’ as their example, have become adepts at following the rules. Every ‘t” is crossed; every “I” is dotted. They follow the Lex, some becoming quite skilled at its interpretation and application. Before -Titus,- of the Silver Ladder, was accused of collusion with the enemies of the pentacle,  he had mandated that Apostates would be banned from Savannah, holding these unknown members of Awakened society accountable for much of what had happened. Oddly enough, ‘‘Siafu’’ rescinded this mandate, allow Apostates back into the city. Her comment on why she allowed the Apostates back into Savannah as a cryptic, “They have made their sacrifice.” %0a> %0a> The Guardians survive, tenacious and dedicated, they believe in ‘‘Siafu’’ and her leadership. They trust in ‘‘Moraceae’’ and his hand as ‘’Siafu’s’’ lieutenant. The Guardians are willing to sacrifice so that others will be free from the lie, they know that their cause, no matter what others think, is just, and that they will be judged for their actions. Their relationship with the other orders is odd at the best. With the ladder they have a bond built from shame and rebuilding. With the Arrows they receive a quiet admiration for those who survive and continue to fight. The Free Council is haughty, self-stylizing themselves as victors who now can act without their mythic threat of the Guardians hanging above them. The Free Council feels it has this freedom, and for some reason they now act more like a traditional Diamond order. And then there is the Mysterium. No one can judge the relationship between the Guardians and Mysterium, there is a chasm between the two, one of polite détente reminiscent of the Cold War.%0a> %0a>  [--%25color=#365776%25[[#top| Back to top]]--]%0a> %0a> [[#GoV-S]]%0a> !!!Guardian Order Status%0a> Forward the goals of the Guardians of the Veil, do so in a manner that never implicates the order, never seems to cross the line.

Many would like to think of the Silver Ladder as little more than popinjays puffed up with self-importance, and sadly some Ladders will fit this bill, but to be a Silver Ladder one must have a confidence that, to some, boarders on arrogance. Self-assurance that their cause is right, that their purpose is just, this is a hallmark of a Silver Ladder. Some might call it hubris, a hubris that goes back prior to the forging of the celestial ladder that would be the doom on Atlantis. These naysayers are the opponents of the Silver Ladder not because of their own investment, they are antagonists fed on the propaganda and muddled history of the other orders and the non-believers.

However, it has been the mission of the Silver Ladder to guide the Awakened in their goal to tap into the supernal mysteries. The Silver Ladder fights to remember the past, not to dwell in it, a part that is often overlooked by other orders. A silver Ladder is aware of his or her Order’s pedigree, but understands that it is the acts of the Silver Ladder today that guide the future. Some lead from the Hierarch’s seat, others as trusted advisor of wizened councilor.

The Free Council, under ‘‘Heron’’ Was merciless for the first two years after the near destruction of the Guardians.

It is not warm, it is not cold., ‘‘Kreig’’ does not appear to share in the joy ‘‘Heron’’ has had in tormenting the Ladder, but he has not supported them either. Perhaps he is watching to see if they are willing to stand back up on their own two feet, if so, the attitude might change. With the Mysterium, the Ladder holds a silent grudge. It was ‘‘Aislin’’ who named ‘‘Titus’’ as a conspirator, but the evidence was never clear, there was no trial, for a moment the Lex was forgotten and passions swept through the Consilium, something has never set right because of that. And then, with the Guardians of the Veil… it is interesting, for orders that most often come to political blows the Guardians of the Veil has left the ladder be, ‘‘Siafu’’ does not say much in most cases, but says even less about the Ladder, yet the Guardians of the Veil have not stopped any progress made by the Ladder even when they had opportunity to do so.%0a> %0a> The Ladder is crawling up the ropes, bloodied but unbowed.

Find and develop ways to encourage mortals to awaken, lead or guide mundane institutions to better themselves and push for their Supernal birthright. At times Silver Ladders will be judged on how they are perceived by others, for better and for worse. Sometimes antagonism is good when it causes positive action. %0a> %0a> Following the establishment of the Consilium, following the Lex Magica and making others see the wisdom of the Lex is also considered when thinking of status. The Ladder cannot be passive in their actions and expect others to notice. Sometimes a velvet glove must cover and iron fist. The Silver ladder follows what are called the Elemental precepts.

The threats to the Awakened world are numerous. From the Awakened servants of the Exarchs known as the Seers of the Throne to the Banishers, the Adamantine Arrow contests with others whose knowledge of the supernal makes them a most dangerous foe.

The soldiers and sailors, athletes and martial artists, politicians and students share common traits: training, discipline, physical and mental conditioning, dedication and strengths in tactics and strategy. And there are the artists and creators, the ones  with the skill to work at the supernal smithies, forging items that some Arrows must use to defeat the greatest of threats.

The threats to the Awakened world are numerous. From the Awakened servants of the Exarchs known as the Seers of the Throne (those dedicated to enslaving the sleeping world with the denial of their supernal birthright,) to the Banishers (the mistaken pariah of their Awakened brethren who seek to eradicate those who are Awakened… including themselves,) the Adamantine Arrow contests with others whose knowledge of the Supernal makes them a most dangerous foe. If this were not enough there are other threats, non-human threats that hunt and haunt the Awakened.  Abyssal  entities which force their way into this plane, the summoned avatars of other realms who break their conjurors’ hold and run rampant in the mundane world, the spirits and ghosts, automatons and more, each one a threat that the Adamantine Arrow is expected to face. Lastly, there are sleepers, humans, who would hunt the Awakened, dangerous individual who have not seen the truth behind the lie, yet threaten the existence of the Awakened people. The Adamantine Arrows is a proud order, taking their roles in the continued survival of the Awakened with a seriousness that is only found in the warrior heroes of the ancient epics.%0a> %0a> The Adamantine Arrows are warriors, but like all squares are rectangles and not all rectangles are squares the Arrow display their roles as a warrior in different ways. Some, yes some are inheritors of the military culture, the solider and sailor, the trained and disciplined Awakened who has spent years learning a mortal craft only to apply it to their Awakened State. They are also the athlete and the martial artist, the dedicated and conditioned mind that is focused and able to understand order and training. There are the politicians, the educated, and the students who learn and develop tactics and strategies to employ against the enemies of the awakened. There are the artists, the creators, the ones who work at the supernal smithies, forging items that some Arrows must use to defeat the greatest of threats. The Adamantine Arrow is not one dimensional, though many cannot see through the wall of warriors to find the apparatus that keeps all militaries running. %0a> %0a> The Adamantine Arrow will always be defined by their relationship to conflict, it is central to their existence, their being. But conflict happens every day in the mundane world, often happening without a shot being fired. The political battlefield is as brutal and demanding as the sands of the Middle East.  The Adamantine Arrow seeks to protect the Awakened, and itself as an Order, against any threat, and there is constant vigilance, a constancy of purpose, and continued acceptance of the challenges place before them. Conflict is eternal, the conflict is life, whether it is mastering a skill or sighting an enemy in the crosshairs of a weapon, the Arrow strive to remain in a constant state of action, life is defined by conflict.%0a>  [--%25color=#365776%25[[#top| Back to top]]--]%0a> %0a979,1039c953,1019%0a%3c !!Adamantine Arrow and the Setting%0a%3c %0a%3c '' "You see it all around us, Consilium after Consilium seeing our service to the Awakened as some form of conscription into a supernal army.

This, in no uncertain terms, makes the Consilium nervous because what ''Krieg'' is doing is not against the Lex in any way, and it would appear that they have no choice but to acquiesce to the way the Order is run. ‘’Krieg’’ has created “fire-teams” that respond to various problems. Starting with the bare minimum of two Arrows, because an Arrow never serves alone, the fire teams operate to support Consilium and Order goals. From this basic unit the Fire Teams can grow in size to up to eight Arrows working in conjunction and often under a First Talon or a brevetted First Talon for an operation.

The relationship with the Free Council is strained, the Arrow disagreeing with the way the “victors” have treated other orders with the upheaval in the past. To the Mysterium, it is hard to tell, it is a political relationship that is hard to judge and to which Krieg has said little about.%0a> %0a> The Arrow are not perfect, the conflict that they encounter and keep in their lives defies the use of this word, but they are organized and they are unified to the outside eye. ‘’Krieg’s’’ subordinates support his methods in public, and in private there is no talk of dissention. The fact that he has promised and kept his word on how he perceives the order has bought him loyalty as a leader that is fierce among the First Talons and the Thunderbolt Guardian. This is not to say he cannot be questioned, questioning and revolution are part of the Phalanxes, but so far, the questions have been few. ‘’Krieg’’ does not hold himself above the mandates he has set, anyone can challenge his leadership… all they have to do is face him in single combat.%0a> %0a> [--%25color=#365776%25[[#top| Back to top]]--]%0a> %0a> [[#AA-OS]]%0a> !!!Adamantine Arrow Order Status%0a> Make sure you have taken a look at the status primer as it will give you the overview for the entire venue.

Contest and conquer objectives as defined by the Adamant Sage or a Ranking Arrow. In combat defeat the enemy if that is the goal, capture if commanded to do so. Never abandon another Arrow in the field, and confrontation with other Arrows is /ALWAYS/ done behind closed does. To the rest of the Consilium, the Arrow is one, pissing contests and jockeying for position is never discussed in front of others. One does not talk about Fight Club. %0a> %0a> Defending the order from attacks, both from the enemies of the Consilium and the Consilium itself is part of the way to gain status. Another way is to forward your understanding of the Arrow and its ways.

Defending the Consilium in times of war, persecuting the enemies in a fashion hat upholds the integrity and the stability of the Consilium, being a presence in the event members of other Consili visit. These are easy ways for the common arrow to rise in some stature. There are other ways, such as taking active roles in the Consilium that the Arrow is part of these roles can include Councilor or Provost to a cabal, the position of Sentinel or of Herald. Also, for enterprising players the character could learn from another order, taking order specific titles (such as the Silver Ladder Factotum [lawyer of the Lex]) as a way to represent the adaptability of the Arrow as an order. The positions of the Consilium and of other order will be discussed in other posts.

After the First Talon has learned to broaden their abilities it is the Thunderbolt Guardian who then relearns a focus and specialty.%0a> %0a> :Status 4+  The Adamant Sage: More than a general, the Adamant Sage is a force.

Because of the collaborative nature of the process, sanctioning through Forum Private Messages will be difficult.%0a%3c %0a%3c Sanctioning typically lasts around a half an hour, but can be longer. There will likely be questions back and forth about experience spends, character history, how these things relate to your character now, and how you anticipate your character interacting with other mages. %0a%3c %0a%3c Based on this discussion, the sanctioning ST may offer additional advice such as contacts, role play hooks, and a background on your order if your character should be in the know.%0a%3c %0a%3c !!Expectations of a Character%0a%3c There will never be a list of characters that the venue really needs and therefore will be easily sanctioned. Similarly, there is no secret list of characters that absolutely won't be allowed in the venue. The character creation guidelines let you know of any restrictions or banned items so there is no mystery.%0a%3c %0a%3c The type of character we want you to play is the character that will make you excited to play! Within character creation guidelines, of course. This may mean that you or another player creates an antagonistic character, and that's perfectly fine. The expectation, however, is that "IC is IC". As such, play your character in your style, but respect others playing characters in their style.%0a%3c %0a%3c Caveat: If a concept, for some reason, absolutely will not fit into the venue, be prepared to discuss options that will correct this. Although the character creation guidelines cover several things we know for sure won't fit, we can't discount the possibility that you'll come up with something new. It's the sanctioning STs responsibility to you, the player, and to the venue to ensure that your character is effectively playable.%0a%3c %0a%3c !!Tips for Your Background%0a%3c Whether your background is written in paragraphs, pages or a bullet point outline, the goal is to show interest and thought in your character. Per the character creation guidelines, there is a checklist of topics that are expected to be covered. These tips are to help give you ideas.%0a%3c * Awakening is an important part of your character. How does it define your character's concept? Current state of existence? Your future outlook? How did the Awakening determine your path? Did it effect the Order you joined? Did it effect your goals and beliefs or your nature and demeanor?%0a%3c * The Nimbus should reflect both your Awakening and your path. Develop and define it as it something other players will see and react to. %0a%3c %0a%3c !!Desanctioning and Sanctioning a New Character%0a%3c Sanctioning is a lengthy process, and while it is understood that a player may find a character to have grown stale, unplayable, or is simply not as shiny as a new idea, there are some ground rules for dropping one character to create another:%0a%3c *'''You may not desanction a character to escape in game repercussion for their actions.''' If a chain of events has been triggered by your character that negatively effects them, they must be seen through until the end.%0a%3c *'''The new character must be a new character.''' Per the character creation guidelines, you cannot remake a character previously played on Wanton Wicked or another site. You cannot resanction a 4.0 character you previously, purposely desanctioned.%0a%3c *'''Your new character cannot piggyback off of your previous character.''' This means that your new character cannot be known by your previous character (family, friend, etc.), and you cannot rely on relationships forged with your previous character. They must create new relationships on their own.%0a%3c **'''If your new character joins a cabal of which you were previously a member, remember that your new character is unfamiliar with the cabal.''' Entering a cabal with prior knowledge of its activities should raise suspicions IC.%0a%3c *'''Frequent desanction/sanctioning of characters may result in a temporary hold on future sanctions.''' It's understood that sometimes characters just don't fit or you can't get into them, however, frequently desanctioning and sanctioning characters takes time and focus from other players. A temporary hold on sanctioning will be instated in an effort to enforce the time you will hopefully be able to create a character that you'll truly enjoy.  %0a---%0a> %0a> !!!Background:%0a> The Human history will not speak for itself, so make sure you include how you were prior to awakening, and how awakening affects you now. it does not need to be super long, doesn't need to be super tragic either, but it does need to be there.%0a> %0a> The Awakening is an important part of a Mage character. In one series of events you are defining not only your current state of existence but your future outlook and concept. Path, Order, Goals, Beliefs, Nature, Demeanor... these and much more can all tie to your awakening. This is something you have to be able to describe and reflect when you create your mage. Now, we are not expecting a New York Best seller from everyone who plays mage. We understand there are different skill and comfort levels with each player. Some people will write pages, others might produce an outline with bullet points. This being said.... Show interest and thought here. Show a pattern of reasoning and a solid grasp of a concept to work with%0a> %0a> The Nimbus must also be developed and defined. As it is the effect magi (and sometimes sleepers) see when a) you let it show, b) when observed with Prime sight while you are casting magic and c) when you invoke Paradox. The Nimbus should reflect both your Awakening and your Path. If you are Obrimos and Awakened in a stormy dreamscape, your nimbus might include windblown hair and arching electrical discharges, for example.%0a> %0a> %0a> We are not here to shoot down your style, your idea, concept or desire, but sometimes it happens. There will be times that we are just going to have to say,"No, that concept will not work in this venue." First off, it is nothing personal. We want to work with you and your concept, but some things we will not approve. Here is a short list of examples that we discourage:%0a> %0a> •	Ex-Seer/Banisher become Good Guy%0a> %0a> •	Cross over Parents%0a> %0a> •	Mage since you were a child ---- parents may have been magically inclined but %0a> please work in that you did not know about their "kink" until later in life.%0a> %0a> %0a> •	Heavy Military involvement%0a> %0a> !!!General Sanction Info:%0a> %0a> All sanctions should be interactive, there should be questions back and forth about why you have spread the dots a certain way, questions about the history and how it relates to your character right now and so on. Take your time and expect a sanction to last around a half hour. I will read your background, I will look up your merits, I will check the point expenditure and ask question about your concept of not only your mage, but how they fit in with other mages. I will offer contacts that make sense for you to know, I will deliver a background for your order if you have a character that should be in the know. I will offer hooks and contacts, open a few doors for you to get in gear and moving. This will be a collaborative effort, not just a yes, no, stamp of approval or denial and out the door moment. A thread ( at this point) will get started and I will flood the hell out of it with required venue information and a disclaimer that you will need to respond to before you get an Icon. It will be a busy time, I promise. %0a> %0a> %0a> This said, Contrary to popular belief, Storytellers are not out to get you and ruin your idea of the character you have created. Storytellers are not out to deny you, or change your sheet. There is no current list of "this is what we need in the venue" and conversely, there is no secret list “this is what we will not allow in the venue.”  In fact, when people ask, "what type of character are you looking for?" The best response a storyteller can give is, "One you will be excited about playing that follows the sanctioning guidelines."Sometimes this means there will be some antagonistic characters in the venue. Good, not everyone gets along IRL, I will not expect everyone to get along here. As long as it is IC and not OOC I really have no issue with two characters going at each other with knives. Will there be sanctioned Seers or Bannisher characters? No, considering that those two books are restricted from player use that means you can’t make characters from them. But outside of that, I won’t ask you to play an angel, not even a fallen one. You do not always have to make nice with others, you can play in your style as long as you respect others playing in their style. Will this cause sparks, well, I certainly hope so, I would hate for anyone to get bored. %0a> %0a> %0a> But, this liberal sanctioning policy will, at times, make other players go "Why the hell did you sanction that." The answer, "The same reason I sanctioned you." As long as there is thought put into the character, that it is not designed to be antagonistic for antagonisms sake, then it has every right a fluffy muppet character has to be sanctioned. This does not mean I will just sanction any and everything that comes across the desk. In the end you can ask who has the right to decide if a concept will fit into the Venue? The storyteller sanctioning the character has this right, but more than this, they have a responsibility to the venue. While I appreciate a player’s effort and their comments, their justifications and reasoning for why their idea is a viable concept, there are certain concepts that the venue may not be able to handle or are counterproductive to role-play. Be prepared to discuss options in the event this happens. I understand I might lose some players by standing firm, but I will protect the venue, and that is the senior responsibility.%0a> %0a> %0a> %0a> %0a> Sanctioning can be a lengthy process. Anything worthwhile has attention paid to it, and sanctioning will be no different. On occasion players will want to change their characters because the need or want to play that concept changes. For whatever reason the old concept has grown stale, unplayable, or a myriad of other scenarios that makes the player start toying with a new concept. While I have no issues with people changing characters, I will set some grounds rules for dropping and recreating a character:%0a> %0a> 1) At no time will we allow a player to stop playing their current character to escape in game repercussions for their actions. If a chain of events has begun, and it is because of a set of actions that a character has set in motion, they need to be seen through until the end. Anyone trying to dodge this by remaking, or having their character pull a Kizer Sose, will see repercussions.%0a> %0a> %0a> 2) We will not allow the new character to be the mirror image/carbon copy of the previous character. If you got tired of, could not play, the previous character why are you remaking it? There is a no remake policy in effect for this venue. %0a> %0a> %0a> 3)  You cannot know your next incarnation. You are de-sanctioning your characte, all ties need to be severed as such. If you have built an in-character relationship of mentor and student. lovers, mage and sleepwalker, et al. when you come in you are fresh off the boat. The bond between a mentor and student, or a sleepwalker and awakened, is supposed to be one of trust and secrecy. You cannot really expect for someone to just blindly trust a change like that.%0a> %0a> %0a> 4) If you are a member of a cabal the new character should not come in knowing everything about the cabal. Mages are, by definition, a secretive lot. If a member of a cabal had a sibling or friend that they told everything to, I think this would make the rest of mages in the cabal suspicious. How could they trust the new member considering the old one told everything about them. Coming in with prior knowledge /should/ bite you in the ass. %0a> %0a> * Note: Notice the use of the word "should" in number four. No, we cannot enforce this but I am pointing it out. %0a> %0a> As an ST team, if there are people who are de-sanctioning and creating new characters, it is our hope that one of the questions we ask will be: " Are all your affairs in order, is there anything outstanding that needs to be taken care of." Your honesty here is appreciated. %0a> %0a> Lastly. Sometimes characters never fit, you can't get into them. I understand that, we all do. However, if you are remaking a character once every month, or every few months, and you are never taking them IC, yet still you want to make a new character, then there is another problem here. We reserve the right to not allow players to cycle through concepts. We reserve the right to give you time off to focus on a concept that you can enjoy and play. This is not us trying to be heavy handed, everything that we do we do to try and make the mage game better. If you are simply dodging consequences or you are holding the foyer down and occasionally just want a new name, then you will be asked to take some time off from the venue. Our goal is to focus on those who want to play, not sanction neat concepts that never get on the stage.%0a1623,1628c1649%0a%3c * Concepts or Histories:%0a%3c **Crossover Parent(s)%0a%3c **Ex-Seer/Banisher turned Good Guy%0a%3c **Extensive knowledge of other Supers in history%0a%3c **Heavy military involvement%0a%3c **Mage (or knowledge of mages) since childhood.

In one series of events you are defining not only your current state of existence but your future outlook and concept. Path, Order, Goals, Beliefs, Nature, Demeanor... these and much more can all tie to your awakening. This is something you have to be able to describe and reflect when you create your mage. Now, we are not expecting a New York Best seller from everyone who plays mage. We understand there are different skill and comfort levels with each player. Some people will write pages, others might produce an outline with bullet points. This being said.... Show interest and thought here.

I.e: you only get from the order you are in and not the one you have left.%0a%3c %0a%3c !!!General Sanction Info:%0a%3c %0a%3c All sanctions should be interactive, there should be questions back and forth about why you have spread the dots a certain way, questions about the history and how it relates to your character right now and so on. Take your time and expect a sanction to last around a half hour. I will read your background, I will look up your merits, I will check the point expenditure and ask question about your concept of not only your mage, but how they fit in with other mages. I will offer contacts that make sense for you to know, I will deliver a background for your order if you have a character that should be in the know. I will offer hooks and contacts, open a few doors for you to get in gear and moving. This will be a collaborative effort, not just a yes, no, stamp of approval or denial and out the door moment. A thread ( at this point) will get started and I will flood the hell out of it with required venue information and a disclaimer that you will need to respond to before you get an Icon. It will be a busy time, I promise. %0a%3c %0a%3c %0a%3c This said, Contrary to popular belief, Storytellers are not out to get you and ruin your idea of the character you have created. Storytellers are not out to deny you, or change your sheet. There is no current list of "this is what we need in the venue" and conversely, there is no secret list “this is what we will not allow in the venue.”  In fact, when people ask, "what type of character are you looking for?" The best response a storyteller can give is, "One you will be excited about playing that follows the sanctioning guidelines."Sometimes this means there will be some antagonistic characters in the venue. Good, not everyone gets along IRL, I will not expect everyone to get along here. As long as it is IC and not OOC I really have no issue with two characters going at each other with knives. Will there be sanctioned Seers or Bannisher characters? No, considering that those two books are restricted from player use that means you can’t make characters from them. But outside of that, I won’t ask you to play an angel, not even a fallen one. You do not always have to make nice with others, you can play in your style as long as you respect others playing in their style. Will this cause sparks, well, I certainly hope so, I would hate for anyone to get bored. %0a%3c %0a%3c %0a%3c But, this liberal sanctioning policy will, at times, make other players go "Why the hell did you sanction that." The answer, "The same reason I sanctioned you." As long as there is thought put into the character, that it is not designed to be antagonistic for antagonisms sake, then it has every right a fluffy muppet character has to be sanctioned. This does not mean I will just sanction any and everything that comes across the desk. In the end you can ask who has the right to decide if a concept will fit into the Venue? The storyteller sanctioning the character has this right, but more than this, they have a responsibility to the venue. While I appreciate a player’s effort and their comments, their justifications and reasoning for why their idea is a viable concept, there are certain concepts that the venue may not be able to handle or are counterproductive to role-play. Be prepared to discuss options in the event this happens. I understand I might lose some players by standing firm, but I will protect the venue, and that is the senior responsibility.%0a%3c %0a%3c %0a%3c %0a%3c %0a%3c Sanctioning can be a lengthy process. Anything worthwhile has attention paid to it, and sanctioning will be no different. On occasion players will want to change their characters because the need or want to play that concept changes. For whatever reason the old concept has grown stale, unplayable, or a myriad of other scenarios that makes the player start toying with a new concept. While I have no issues with people changing characters, I will set some grounds rules for dropping and recreating a character:%0a%3c %0a%3c 1) At no time will we allow a player to stop playing their current character to escape in game repercussions for their actions. If a chain of events has begun, and it is because of a set of actions that a character has set in motion, they need to be seen through until the end. Anyone trying to dodge this by remaking, or having their character pull a Kizer Sose, will see repercussions.%0a%3c %0a%3c %0a%3c 2) We will not allow the new character to be the mirror image/carbon copy of the previous character. If you got tired of, could not play, the previous character why are you remaking it? There is a no remake policy in effect for this venue. %0a%3c %0a%3c %0a%3c 3)  You cannot know your next incarnation. You are de-sanctioning your characte, all ties need to be severed as such. If you have built an in-character relationship of mentor and student. lovers, mage and sleepwalker, et al. when you come in you are fresh off the boat. The bond between a mentor and student, or a sleepwalker and awakened, is supposed to be one of trust and secrecy. You cannot really expect for someone to just blindly trust a change like that.%0a%3c %0a%3c %0a%3c 4) If you are a member of a cabal the new character should not come in knowing everything about the cabal. Mages are, by definition, a secretive lot. If a member of a cabal had a sibling or friend that they told everything to, I think this would make the rest of mages in the cabal suspicious.

However, if you are remaking a character once every month, or every few months, and you are never taking them IC, yet still you want to make a new character, then there is another problem here. We reserve the right to not allow players to cycle through concepts. We reserve the right to give you time off to focus on a concept that you can enjoy and play. This is not us trying to be heavy handed, everything that we do we do to try and make the mage game better. If you are simply dodging consequences or you are holding the foyer down and occasionally just want a new name, then you will be asked to take some time off from the venue. Our goal is to focus on those who want to play, not sanction neat concepts that never get on the stage.%0a%3c %0a%3c %0a---%0a> * A skill at four dots costs mages two restricted slots rather than one.%0a> * Gnosis 3 is one restricted slot.%0a> * Access to Second Sight powers is one restricted slot.

No character should be hamstrung waiting on an order head because the body of councilors will be doing a majority of the work. Unlike the core which suggests that the orders and the paths be the ruling Council it is more manageable and active to use councilors made of cabal heads. These are the groups that dictate the day to day policies and actions of the Consilium. It requires people who wish to be cabal heads to understand there is some work to be done. All of you have been in games where there is a cabal that is a paper tiger, only coming on to deal in politics and sometimes making a mess of things. This system will help combat that lethargy. You have to be active, your cabal has to be active for you to keep a vote. A majority vote keeps the process simple, the ability to remove other councilors and even an order head is a HUGE issue and should not be treated lightly. It’s difficult, but it can be done. It also allows for a realistic Consilium where not every mage and their brother need attend a meeting. This way you don’t have to scroll through 4 pages of chatter to get to the first question.%0a> %0a> I want you, the players, to define your Consilium, to define how the Lex is interpreted and applied in game. I want you to be the ones who fight for rules, laws, and mandates that are created by one another. This is another step in the process to offer you another tier in which to operate, to have allies and enemies. You will be encouraged to push order business through by way of the Herald, you will deal with one another and the masses by way of the Sentinel, you will police each other with your position as Councilor. %0a> >>%3c%3c%0a> %0a694c700,702%0a%3c %0a---%0a> (:toggle hide pcp-f button=1:)%0a> >>id=pcp-f border='1px solid #999' padding=5px bgcolor=#c5d8ee%3c%3c %0a> %0a725a734,738%0a> %0a> :ST Note:%0a> The political game will happen. As with all WoD splats, politics is part and parcel of the game. Personally, I like always keeping a knife under the robes when hanging out with senators, keeps you on your toes. The political game will exist for people who want it, but, remember that line from Constantine when Rachel Weisz says “I don’t believe in the Devil,” and Keanu ‘Whoa!’ Reeves responds with “Why not? He believes in you.” That is how politics will work, you may not want to play the political game, but you sure as hell can feel its effects. If someone does something politically that you do not like you cannot “opt out” of the effects, and what is more, spending willpower will not change the outcome for you. This said, you don’t have to play politics, make friends who like to play politics and develop a buffer.%0a> >>%3c%3c%0a> %0a727c740,742%0a%3c %0a---%0a> (:toggle hide pcp-h button=1:)%0a> >>id=pcp-h border='1px solid #999' padding=5px bgcolor=#c5d8ee%3c%3c %0a> %0a747,748c762,767%0a%3c %0a%3c %0a---%0a> :ST Note:%0a> A natural question will be, “what is stopping the order heads from operating directly with the councilors?” The answer is this, détente. Sure, an order head can speak with a Councilor of their own order without much though, but to speak with councilors of other orders, well, they need to be polite. The order heads are status 4 and 5 individuals but they are not above the Lex or the Consilium. The Herald acts as a conduit to and from lower status mages, and unaligned mages, because order heads do not always answer the messages left by status one or zero mages. %0a> %0a> The practical application of the Herald position gives a clear and concise chain of communication. You want business with an order head you go through a Herald or you have the Herald arrange a meeting. This should remove the wait for NPC’s for action. It drives the IC aspect of the political game. It removes some of potential ST Fiat and gives you more avenues to explore Role-play. %0a> >>%3c%3c%0a> %0a750c769,771%0a%3c %0a---%0a> (:toggle hide pcp-s button=1:)%0a> >>id=pcp-s border='1px solid #999' padding=5px bgcolor=#c5d8ee%3c%3c %0a> %0a770,771c791,795%0a%3c %0a%3c %0a---%0a> :ST Note:%0a> %0a> ST Note: The Sentinel is not exactly a policeman, nor exactly a politician, but they sometimes fill these roles. The Sentinels look to make sure that violations of the Lex are met responsibly and with organization.

The Adamantine Arrow is not simply a “break glass in case of war” order. They compete amongst themselves, they compete against the Consilium and they compete, in many ways, against the sleeping world. When thinking of a concept for an Arrow, realize that no army is without an infrastructure, a bureaucracy, and its politicians. Sometimes the most important person in the battle is the one who can position the troops in the right place at the right time. %0a> %0a> The skills you take as an Arrow will be varied, but you should include at least one fighting style. Stamina is more important than brute force for the Adamantine Arrow for a multitude of reasons; one of the most important reasons is stamina defines how many spells can be cast on your character (by your character or by others) before you take a negative modifier(s) as your pattern frays/overloads. When you pick you skills think of your concept and work up from there. A scout doesn’t necessarily have to be the combat wombat; they may prefer never to be seen instead using arcana to enhance mundane abilities. The strategist will be higher mental than the politician who will need social combat skills. Remember, the Arrow is not all “Rawr, Kill.” What some do with a sword others will do with a knife and still others do with a word.

The Free Council looks to tomorrow, some do so blindly, regardless of the lessons of the past. Some look forward with peril to their soul, their health, their integrity. Others carefully plot their course, looking to play the game of the Awakened, politicians as ruthless and cunning as any found in the Diamond. These are the heralds of the future, or so they would have you believe, and some actually live up to the billing.%0a> %0a> The skills needed by the Free Council cannot be quantified as an order. A scientist is not the same as a student; a revolutionary is not the same as a martyr.  Dedication to the cause can appear in a myriad of ways that are customizable to the character being played. In some ways physical stats will be important if a Libertine is going the might makes right route, to others it will be social or mental attributes and skills that are prized.

They are like any other order, diverse and driven with a combination of order and personal goals. They have an interest in knowledge that is shared, but its interpretation is a personal one. The Mysterium is organized, very organized as one might suspect. Positions carry weight, and the access to further mysteries is strictly governed. Those who perform are rewarded, but with each reward come more responsibility, and more questions. The Mysterium seeks… that is the best way to say it. They seek, but what they seek is just part of the secret of being a member of the Mysterium.%0a> %0a> It is safe to say that mental skills are highly valued by the Mysterium. But that is just a little too easy. The ability to communicate is balanced with the ability to research. Patience is more than a virtue with the Mysterium, it is a requirement. Many of the younger members take time in learning this skill, but it is one that will serve them well during their time as a Mystie.  Something the Mysterium player must remember is that not everyone will want to question, want to look for the hidden secret or the obscure fact. During these times it comes down to those Mysterium members who are strong enough to influence others to assert themselves. Mysterium member must have the potential to lead, especially in times where their skills are the best use to the party. They need to know when silence and reserve must be put on the shelf and action must occur.

Some people do try to play the Ladder in this manner, but that is limiting in many ways. Mages do not respond to the power of ancient families when they have the same amount of power themselves. Blue blood spills as fast are red and white collars can be toppled by blue. The silver Ladder should be the role of a leader, or of a trusted advisor. These characters are more than boardroom executives who move pieces on a phantasmal chessboard. The Silver Ladder rewards leading from the front, helming the course of the Awakened nation in the form of a Consilium or a Cabal as well as providing leadership and counsel to the mortals who still slumber. %0a> The skills for a Ladder will be varied,  but expression and the ability to communicate are key. Whether a scholar, or a preacher denouncing the sins of the flesh and alcohol on a campus, the Ladder character must be able to communicate. This is not to say there are not warriors among the Ladder, the warrior caste, for a lack of a better term, is versed in combat that could include sword or a pen. Sometimes more is done with a word or a signature than even an army could accomplish, and the Silver Ladder player should remember this. Ladders are meant to be dynamic individuals, with great risk comes great reward.%0a> %0a>  [--%25color=#365776%25[[#top| Back to top]]--]%0a> %0a1347a1429,1430%0a> Make sure you have taken a look at the status primer as it will give you the overview for the entire venue.

Caught between two worlds, knowing one exists, and you are meant to be part of it, even as you are tethered to another. Sleepwalkers are not the butlers and the secretaries of the awakened; they do not exist only to interact with the mundane world. Nor are they blind followers or baby-making machines meant to propagate the species; mages are still human and anyone can awaken. Sleepwalkers, instead, hold an odd place in Awakened society. A position that appears to be part resource, part favored child, the sleepwalkers represent a potential future but remain grounded in the present. For some reason they have pierced the veil, they can see some of the machinations of the Supernal, but for some reason they have not made the journey to their watchtower. Theirs is a life of mystery, mystery and frustration. They see what their potential could be, they are teased with the Supernal gift that has been given to others, but they are only allowed a taste.%0a%3c %0a%3c It does not help that some Awakened forget their human roots, that some see sleepwalkers as little more than a commodity that must be controlled. These Awakened can be abusive, deceitful, unworthy of taking another as their charge. But what then is a sleepwalker to do? A sleepwalker is sore pressed to combat the power of the awakened in this scenario. To gain sanctuary has a cost, one that sleepwalkers are often times unaware of as they are recruited to one order or another. At the same time, there are those sleepwalkers who parlay their existence into a favored status. They have the fortitude to navigate the murky deeps of the Awakened society without having the inherent responsibilities of a Mage. These sleepwalkers are more than lovers or concubines. They are their own forces to be reckoned with, heads of cryptopolies or labyrinths as they exist both in the Supernal and the mundane worlds.%0a%3c %0a%3c Whatever their role, whatever their purpose, sleepwalkers dance along a fine line. To the enemies of the Pentacle they are tools, just as guilty as those whom they owe their allegiance to.  They are ways that the pentacle can be harmed, damaged if a well-placed sleepwalker could be converted, or killed. Sleepwalkers can rise in status, they can be a member of the Consilium should they be trusted enough. Often times this trust is enforced with arcane means. To an awakened this could be seen as a slight, but for a sleepwalker it could merely be the price needed to belong. Sleepwalkers are the future, or so it would seem, but their worth is not assured. A glib sleepwalker might find that they will never awaken as they are lost to this mundane realm by some unfortunate mundane accident. Sometimes this event is not the callous or intentional act of an enemy, but one of a so called “friend.” %0a%3c !!!Sleepwalker Setting%0a%3c (:toggle hide sw-set button=1:)%0a%3c >>id=sw-set border='1px solid #999' padding=5px bgcolor=#c5d8ee%3c%3c %0a%3c WIP%0a%3c >>%3c%3c%0a%3c !!!Playing a Sleepwalker%0a%3c (:toggle hide sw-play button=1:)%0a%3c >>id=sw-play border='1px solid #999' padding=5px bgcolor=#c5d8ee%3c%3c %0a%3c WIP%0a%3c >>%3c%3c%0a%3c %0a%3c [--%25color=#365776%25[[#top| Back to top]]--]%0a1510,1541d1490%0a%3c !!Apostates%0a%3c %0a%3c Apostasy, it’s not exactly the right word all the time. There are apostates, be sure of that, there are those who join an order with the glaze of idealism coating their eyes only to have that momentary bliss stripped from them. Those who join and order and then leave the parent order to join another, yes, those are apostates. Or if they leave an order and don’t join another order at all, then the word apostate fits them quite nicely. But there are those who are similar to freshmen in college, the undeclared, the ones who have not sign up or been recruited. Sometimes the orders come after these unaligned like Greek organizations on major campuses. The spiels are a little too heavy, the pitch a little rough and the orders alienate those they are trying to recruit. Some people just feel the need to do their own thing, to find their way without an organization breathing down their neck. There are members of the pentacle who say this is the reason those who strike out on their own are called apostates, because they eschew the order of the pentacle to plumb the supernal on their own. Again, those who chose to follow this path point out, you have to join before you can be kicked out.%0a%3c %0a%3c The problem with this individualism and the “freedom” associated with being an apostate is that the orders are nominally “in charge.” Not they do not control every square foot of ground, and a city’s reach is often just that, but to make friends with the orders and not be one is a bit more difficult than it sounds. Apostates tend to have a hard time because the Guardian’s like to use them as ways to join other others, as do the Mysterium from time to time. Then there are Bannishers who use the title of apostates, often mention to them by a member of the pentacle, before they strike against their “so-called” new friends. Finally, there are Seers who and completely a peace with using an apostate’s “freedom” for their own machinations. Considering these things, there is a lot less of “I do what I want,” and a lot more of “I can’t do much at all.” The life of an apostate is not easy, but that is the price to pay for the freedom afforded outside of an order.%0a%3c %0a%3c Some apostates can exist within a Consilium, they can become trusted; can even attain positions within the Consilium. This road is difficult; debts are accrued along the way and there is always a bit of suspicion regarding the awakened who exists within the Consilium without belonging to it. Loyalty is an interesting word, and it will be thrown about like slings and arrows. The enterprising apostate learns how to throw it back, carefully though. The apostate who exists in a Consilium does so at the sufferance of others and they must always remember that.%0a%3c !!! Apostate Setting%0a%3c (:toggle hide apost-set button=1:)%0a%3c >>id=apost-set border='1px solid #999' padding=5px bgcolor=#c5d8ee%3c%3c %0a%3c Apostates are just making it back to the city, there had been a lull, a dead zone, for a while. Specifically, a five year “ban” on Apostates of any kind has just been rescinded, rescinded by a Hierarch who has every motivation to keep it in place.  For the last five year those who wished to leave their orders knuckled down and kept their mouths’ shut, for those not in orders, they were quickly asked to leave the city or sign up with an order. The life of an Apostate was short, sometimes violent, but that has changed… somewhat.%0a%3c %0a%3c Five years ago it was a bit different, Apostates were common enough, but in no great numbers. The city had a balance about it, the orders acting in what many might consider a “Business as Usual” fashion. Then there was a slight increase in those claiming to be Apostates. At first many thought it was just a batch of Guardian trying to test out their infiltration skills, trying to get in with the Apostates and then move on to other cities. One of the problems in being in a small city, especially one as old as Savannah, is that everyone knows someone who knows someone. Using the Apostate cover to get into other orders just didn’t work well, but it did provide a decent cover to move elsewhere. %0a%3c %0a%3c So the orders felt it was the Guardians, the Guardian of course denied this, and the Apostates just acted like the grown-ups were squabbling by going about their own business. Turns out, the Guardians were telling the truth, and the other orders should have listened. In a week of turmoil, terror and death, the Guardians of the Veil were culled as an order. Many of the so called “apostates” vanished, leaving a handful behind to bear the wrath of a Consilium looking for a scapegoat. Those who remained, they knew nothing, some had been in Savannah for years, quietly following their Supernal path. Now, now the Consilium was looking for revenge, for blood, and for an enemy… Apostates felt the  wrath of an angry people.%0a%3c %0a%3c That was five years ago, and it is only now that some few apostates are coming back to the city. Theirs is not an easy life, suspicion and distrust steeped in memory color any interactions with those who do not join orders. This is the Old South at its finest, one with a memory that is slow to forget. Oddly enough, the ban the city had on Apostates was lifted by someone who might have had every reason to keep it in place.%0a%3c >>%3c%3c%0a%3c !!!Status%0a%3c (:toggle hide apost-stat button=1:)%0a%3c >>id=apost-stat border='1px solid #999' padding=5px bgcolor=#c5d8ee%3c%3c %0a%3c There is no “order” status for an apostate. It is possible to gain status in the Consilium as an apostate, but doing so will take some work. It is possible to play a political game in which you can maneuver yourself into a position like a herald or a sentinel, but doing so will be difficult. The sentinel and the herald represent their respective orders, so when those positions are open, they are often filed with order members. Apostates have no representation in the Consilium unless they become the leader of a cabal, and even then, the Consilium will have to recognize the cabal. Not even the free council will be “encouraged” to recognize an all-apostate cabal. So, be smart, play the game wisely if you are looking to get into politics as an apostate.%0a%3c >>%3c%3c%0a%3c !!!Playing an Apostate%0a%3c (:toggle hide apost-play button=1:)%0a%3c >>id=apost-play border='1px solid #999' padding=5px bgcolor=#c5d8ee%3c%3c %0a%3c It is possible to do, but it will not be easy.

There are those who have made it before you, and those who will come after, and like the adverts say, “Your Mileage may Vary.” Some make the journey across time, space and the abyss, they reach the lands supernal only to have their reality torn into fragments that can never quite be reassembled. This is not the story of Humpty Dumpty, though the analogy might be the same, all the pentacle mages could not put these poor souls back together again. Bannishers are boogey men and women, they are the insane, the broken, the hushed stories told over supernal campfires and whispered when the shadows cross window panes. They are myths, and they are real. Not all awakenings bring the Supernal-self closer to enlightenment. For whatever reasons, the Bannishers cannot make peace with what they are, and they look for ways to eradicate magic from this world. They know that they are part of the problem, but before they go, they seek to erase as many blasphemies from this plane as they can… starting with you.%0a%3c %0a%3c Seers are poster children compared to Bannishers. Where the Bannishers are random, erratic and obscured the Seers are organized, driven, and focused to a fault. When not warring within themselves comparing doctrine sized and whang lengths they are happy to destroy the ideal, and the members of the Pentacle. Conversion, assassination, exploitation and seduction are all tools in the kit of the Seer. They want the world to remain asleep, they do not care to share power, they do not need an awakened nation. They serve very strict masters who do not play well with others, not even among themselves. This is a war that is fought in shadows and on street corners. Between allies and contacts, henchmen and flunkies, the war exists on many levels. Direct confrontation does happen, but that is a vulgar exception to the rule. The Seers would rather snipe away, erode the support and the patience of their target before the strike. Unlike the Bannishers, this war has certain rules, though, they constantly change.%0a%3c %0a%3c The Abyss is a constant, a dangerous entity in and of itself. It is ever present, every vulgar spell a reminder that it exists, that it grows. But what is worse is that there are creatures in the Abyss that hunger. Some for flesh, other for souls, The denizens of the Abyss are numberless, often nameless, but they are consistent. They want, the need, something that the Abyss is lacking. Whether it is a material form, a soul, or the blood of a victim, Abyssal creatures are not to be trifled with. Negotiation only works for so much, and some creatures cannot communicate to negotiate. %0a%3c %0a%3c Demons, spirits, ghosts, the stuff of myth and legend. Mages are the stuff of myth and legend as well, and they are very real. Spirits and ghost can be fountains of information, they can be allies, they can be enemies. Tread lightly in the realms of the dead, the twilight, the astral planes and other places where only Mages can go. An enemy made elsewhere can follow you home. As for Demons, not all entities come from the Abyss, there are those things that only religions seem to explain, and they are dangerous indeed. %0a%3c %0a%3c The sleeping world, those who need to awaken. Some sleepwalk, others remain blind. It is easy to make someone hate you, and a mortal with a gun can be as dangerous as a Seer with a spell. Crime of passion, revenge, simple human brutality, humans are as dangerous as any other creature in the world.

The threats to the Awakened world are numerous. From the Awakened servants of the Exarchs known as the Seers of the Throne (those dedicated to enslaving the sleeping world with the denial of their supernal birthright,) to the Banishers (the mistaken pariah of their Awakened brethren who seek to eradicate those who are Awakened… including themselves,) the Adamantine Arrow contests with others whose knowledge of the Supernal makes them a most dangerous foe. If this were not enough there are other threats, non-human threats that hunt and haunt the Awakened.  Abyssal  entities which force their way into this plane, the summoned avatars of other realms who break their conjurors’ hold and run rampant in the mundane world, the spirits and ghosts, automatons and more, each one a threat that the Adamantine Arrow is expected to face. Lastly, there are sleepers, humans, who would hunt the Awakened, dangerous individual who have not seen the truth behind the lie, yet threaten the existence of the Awakened people. The Adamantine Arrows is a proud order, taking their roles in the continued survival of the Awakened with a seriousness that is only found in the warrior heroes of the ancient epics.%0a%3c %0a%3c The Adamantine Arrows are warriors, but like all squares are rectangles and not all rectangles are squares the Arrow display their roles as a warrior in different ways. Some, yes some are inheritors of the military culture, the solider and sailor, the trained and disciplined Awakened who has spent years learning a mortal craft only to apply it to their Awakened State. They are also the athlete and the martial artist, the dedicated and conditioned mind that is focused and able to understand order and training. There are the politicians, the educated, and the students who learn and develop tactics and strategies to employ against the enemies of the awakened. There are the artists, the creators, the ones who work at the supernal smithies, forging items that some Arrows must use to defeat the greatest of threats. The Adamantine Arrow is not one dimensional, though many cannot see through the wall of warriors to find the apparatus that keeps all militaries running. %0a%3c %0a%3c The Adamantine Arrow will always be defined by their relationship to conflict, it is central to their existence, their being. But conflict happens every day in the mundane world, often happening without a shot being fired. The political battlefield is as brutal and demanding as the sands of the Middle East.  The Adamantine Arrow seeks to protect the Awakened, and itself as an Order, against any threat, and there is constant vigilance, a constancy of purpose, and continued acceptance of the challenges place before them. Conflict is eternal, the conflict is life, whether it is mastering a skill or sighting an enemy in the crosshairs of a weapon, the Arrow strive to remain in a constant state of action, life is defined by conflict.%0a%3c  [--%25color=#365776%25[[#top| Back to top]]--]%0a%3c %0a%3c [[#AA-P]]%0a%3c !!!Playing an Adamantine Arrow%0a%3c %0a%3c The arrow is much more varied than the core lets on. The Adamantine Arrow is not simply a “break glass in case of war” order. They compete amongst themselves, they compete against the Consilium and they compete, in many ways, against the sleeping world. When thinking of a concept for an Arrow, realize that no army is without an infrastructure, a bureaucracy, and its politicians. Sometimes the most important person in the battle is the one who can position the troops in the right place at the right time. %0a%3c %0a%3c The skills you take as an Arrow will be varied, but you should include at least one fighting style. Stamina is more important than brute force for the Adamantine Arrow for a multitude of reasons; one of the most important reasons is stamina defines how many spells can be cast on your character (by your character or by others) before you take a negative modifier(s) as your pattern frays/overloads. When you pick you skills think of your concept and work up from there. A scout doesn’t necessarily have to be the combat wombat; they may prefer never to be seen instead using arcana to enhance mundane abilities. The strategist will be higher mental than the politician who will need social combat skills. Remember, the Arrow is not all “Rawr, Kill.” What some do with a sword others will do with a knife and still others do with a word. You have flexibility here.%0a%3c %0a%3c  [--%25color=#365776%25[[#top| Back to top]]--]%0a%3c %0a%3c [[#AA-S]]%0a%3c !!!Adamantine Arrow Setting%0a%3c "You see it all around us, Consilium after Consilium seeing our service to the Awakened as some form of conscription into a supernal army. More than one councilor, more than one Hierarch has thrown us in harm's way with little in the way of support, or worry, for our own safety. We are the Adamantine Arrow, we are not mindless machines that are to be used at the whim of those who think they know better. In the past, you may have expected blind submission to the word of the Consilium. That was the past. We, the Adamantine Arrow will continue to serve the Consilium of Consilium, but we will never again serve blindly; and because you have wasted our goodwill, we will no longer serve for free." ‘‘Kreig’’ addressing ‘’Titus’’, Silver Ladder Hierarch and the Savannah Consilium, August 2002%0a%3c %0a%3c The Arrow of Savannah are under the guidance of Adamant Sage ‘’Krieg’’ and the Arrows exist in an odd nervous détente with the other orders. ‘’Krieg’’ has seen the Adamantine Arrow used as the meat shield for politicos in times of war, only to be discarded or made into pariahs for the zeal they use to defend a Consilium. ‘‘Kreig’’ left his previous Consilium over a decade ago, disgusted with the way the Arrow was treated, and what was worse, the way the Arrow accepted this treatment… Krieg refused to let this happen again. %0a%3c %0a%3c The Arrow is almost mercenary in regards to a mustering of a full order. When other orders need the use of specific Arrows, then there is a price for their service. While Krieg does not require Arrows who have joined cabals to charge a tithe to their cabal mates, but when specialists are needed there is always a fee. This, in no uncertain terms, makes the Consilium nervous because what Krieg is doing is not against the Lex in any way, and it would appear that they have no choice but to acquiesce to the way the Order is run. ‘’Krieg’’ has created “fire-teams” that respond to various problems. Starting with the bare minimum of two Arrows, because an Arrow never serves alone, the fire teams operate to support Consilium and Order goals. From this basic unit the Fire Teams can grow in size to up to eight Arrows working in conjunction and often under a First Talon or a brevetted First Talon for an operation. While operational “command” of these units can be under the leadership of another Awakened, strategic and tactical command always resides in the hands of the ranking Arrow or the deal is not agreed to. %0a%3c %0a%3c Right now there is loyalty to the Consilium, but at what price? The relationship with the Guardians of the Veil is neutral to oddly friendly; the Order respects the position the Guardians of the Veil, seeing them as survivors in way. Despite public opposition to the order, ‘‘Kreig’’ appears to support their current mission. The relationship with the Silver Ladder is … cool, each Order seeming to respect the other and not looking to enforce their internal policies on another. The relationship with the Free Council is strained, the Arrow disagreeing with the way the “victors” have treated other orders with the upheaval in the past. To the Mysterium, it is hard to tell, it is a political relationship that is hard to judge and to which Krieg has said little about.%0a%3c %0a%3c The Arrow are not perfect, the conflict that they encounter and keep in their lives defies the use of this word, but they are organized and they are unified to the outside eye. ‘’Krieg’s’’ subordinates support his methods in public, and in private there is no talk of dissention. The fact that he has promised and kept his word on how he perceives the order has bought him loyalty as a leader that is fierce among the First Talons and the Thunderbolt Guardian. This is not to say he cannot be questioned, questioning and revolution are part of the Phalanxes, but so far, the questions have been few. ‘’Krieg’’ does not hold himself above the mandates he has set, anyone can challenge his leadership… all they have to do is face him in single combat.%0a%3c %0a%3c [--%25color=#365776%25[[#top| Back to top]]--]%0a%3c %0a%3c [[#AA-OS]]%0a%3c !!!Adamantine Arrow Order Status%0a%3c Make sure you have taken a look at the status primer as it will give you the overview for the entire venue. This portion will be broken down into two distinct parts. The status in the order and the status in the Consilium:%0a%3c %0a%3c To gain status in the order begins with what is covered in the status primer. Forward the goals of the arrows. Contest and conquer objectives as defined by the Adamant Sage or a Ranking Arrow. In combat defeat the enemy if that is the goal, capture if commanded to do so. Never abandon another Arrow in the field, and confrontation with other Arrows is /ALWAYS/ done behind closed does. To the rest of the Consilium, the Arrow is one, pissing contests and jockeying for position is never discussed in front of others. One does not talk about Fight Club. %0a%3c %0a%3c Defending the order from attacks, both from the enemies of the Consilium and the Consilium itself is part of the way to gain status. Another way is to forward your understanding of the Arrow and its ways. In the Adamantine Arrow supplement there are core ideals called the [[#AA-Ph|Phalanxes]].%0a%3c %0a%3c [--%25color=#365776%25[[#top| Back to top]]--]%0a%3c %0a%3c [[#AA-CS]]%0a%3c !!!Adamantine Arrows and Consilium Status%0a%3c An Arrow can gain status in the Consilium by performing Consilium required tasks, many of which will parallel tasks assigned by the order. Defending the Consilium in times of war, persecuting the enemies in a fashion hat upholds the integrity and the stability of the Consilium, being a presence in the event members of other Consili visit. These are easy ways for the common arrow to rise in some stature. There are other ways, such as taking active roles in the Consilium that the Arrow is part of these roles can include Councilor or Provost to a cabal, the position of Sentinel or of Herald. Also, for enterprising players the character could learn from another order, taking order specific titles (such as the Silver Ladder Factotum [lawyer of the Lex]) as a way to represent the adaptability of the Arrow as an order. The positions of the Consilium and of other order will be discussed in other posts.

If you have the book you are willing to read the information there, but more importantly, you will define these concepts in your character’s terms. When looking to advance you will be required to understand and define what these ideals mean in game for you. It will take a little bit of writing, but you do not have to write a novella. Also, you will not have to write on each subject, when looking to advance you will be given a selection of these ideals and you need to format them in a way that is congruent to how you have been playing your character. Status will not just be handed out because you want to rise in rank, there is some work to do.%0a%3c %0a%3c  [--%25color=#365776%25[[#top| Back to top]]--]%0a%3c %0a%3c [[#AA-Pos]]%0a%3c !!!Positions in the Adamantine Arrow%0a%3c Status 0-1 - Talon - Rank and File member of the order. Welcome to fight club.%0a%3c %0a%3c :Status 1 Banner Warden: An Arrow who has proven their worth and has joined a cabal can earn the title  of Banner Warden. They, in essence, become the champion for the cabal, accepting duels and often becoming the second in command in a cabal. In formal situations, it is the Banner Warden who carries the “arms” or the “heraldry” of the cabal when meeting others. (Side note, normally  order responsibilities are lessened on a Banner Warden as the Arrow respects their commitment to a cabal.)%0a%3c %0a%3c :Status 2 First Talon: An Arrow reaching First Talon is now “officer” status, they can command in the field and are usually being groomed in other forms of combat than their natural battlefield. A politician begins to learn more hand to hand, a combat mage begins to develop more tactics. These are the “doers” in the Order.%0a%3c %0a%3c :Status 3 Thunderbolt Guardian: To many the Thunderbolt Guardian is seen as a higher ranking officer, but in practice the Thunderbolt Guardian is supposed to be the teacher or mentor to other arrows as they continue their conflict. At this level they are also the specialists, if a Talon is the infantry then Thunderbolt Guardians are Delta. After the First Talon has learned to broaden their abilities it is the Thunderbolt Guardian who then relearns a focus and specialty.%0a%3c %0a%3c :Status 4+  The Adamant Sage: More than a general, the Adamant Sage is a force. They are often times masters of multiple arcana; they have honed their focus as a Thunderbolt Guardian to transcend practice into art. They are pinnacles of the Arrow, and are often counselors to the Consilium in more ways than just in times of war. The Adamant Sage is the Vision of the Arrow in an area, they are required to be more than just powerful Awakened, and they are to balance their supernal with mundane skills and abilities as well.%0a%3c %0a%3c  [--%25color=#365776%25[[#top| Back to top]]--]%0a%3c %0a%3c  [[#FC]]%0a%3c !!The Free Council%0a%3c %25lfloat text-align=center margin-top=5px margin-right=15px margin-bottom=5px margin-left=0px%25http://wantonwicked.gamingsandbox.com/wiki/images/mta/symbols/mta_logo_fc.png%0a%3c “We want the world and we want it now!” Famous lyrics from a song that half of this generation would never recognize amid the auto-tuned synth-pop that is mass marketed and fed to the youth like genetically altered feed to cows. This is the Free Council, the revolution with a cause that is the sword of Damocles poised above the throats of the wise. Escape the past, leave the shackles of failure and of Atlantis and strive to the future. This is part of the perception of the Free Council. To some the Libertines are little more than raving lunatics, fanatics bent on taking the history and the tradition of Atlantis and trading upon it in some fevered lemming rush to a supposed Democratic Utopia. If it were that easy then maybe the landscape of the Pentacle would have changed.%0a%3c %0a%3c It’s never that easy.%0a%3c %0a%3c Yes, there are those who fit the mold of the anarchist, the revolutionary, and they martyr…never forget the martyrs. But there are also the teachers, the educators, the historians and those who seek to build on the mistakes of the past to provide for a better future. To some, the only difference between the Free Council and the Silver Ladder is public relations and press coverage. The Free Council do look to the future, often time chafing at the plodding of the Diamond in its slow trek to Ascension.  The Free Council is made up of as many half-truths as any of the other orders. The Free Council is not free, and it is not exactly a Council. Without organization the libertines would have never succeeded in formulating their own order, without sacrifice and adherence to as many mandates and policies as the other order the Order would have crumbled under its own weight. The cogs of progress are lubricated with the ideals of the visionaries, but the pathway to hell is coated in their good intentions.%0a%3c %0a%3c To be a Libertine is to understand an internal conflict, to strive for a future set on the ruins of the past. Instead of blind ambition the rose colored glasses of idealism are often the most common possession of many a Libertine’s satchel of useful tools. Belief in the future of all awakened, belief that something better is still to come; these are some of the hallmarks of the Libertines. Derision to those stuck in the past, a jester’s mocking of the king, the conflict of the Free Council and the Atlantean Orders is not a war. There must be someone willing to question the past, someone willing to use it to light the future. When the other orders develop tunnel vision based on myth it is the Free Council’s job to light the fire, to burn away superstition and show what potential awaits the Awakened nation.%0a%3c %0a%3c Activist, politician, teacher, conspiracy theorist, anyone can be a member of the Free Council. Some will teach, others will learn. Some will lead and others will follow. The Free Council is not an army of mindless revolutionaries, instead they are a group of Awakened that know the best is yet to come.%0a%3c %0a%3c  [--%25color=#365776%25[[#top| Back to top]]--]%0a%3c %0a%3c [[#FC-P]]%0a%3c !!!Playing a Libertine%0a%3c Like any other order, there are stereotypes. “Revolution Calling” is not just a song by Queensryche, it is a prevailing concept in the Free Council and the application of this thought is as different as the members who make up the Order. The Free Council looks to tomorrow, some do so blindly, regardless of the lessons of the past. Some look forward with peril to their soul, their health, their integrity. Others carefully plot their course, looking to play the game of the Awakened, politicians as ruthless and cunning as any found in the Diamond. These are the heralds of the future, or so they would have you believe, and some actually live up to the billing.%0a%3c %0a%3c The skills needed by the Free Council cannot be quantified as an order. A scientist is not the same as a student; a revolutionary is not the same as a martyr.  Dedication to the cause can appear in a myriad of ways that are customizable to the character being played. In some ways physical stats will be important if a Libertine is going the might makes right route, to others it will be social or mental attributes and skills that are prized.  Try not to pigeon hold you Libertine with the thought that everything must happen now, look for the long game, the future is coming no matter what you say or do. It is up to the Free Council to try and shape it to be better than the past.%0a%3c %0a%3c  [--%25color=#365776%25[[#top| Back to top]]--]%0a%3c %0a%3c [[#FC-S]]%0a%3c !!!Free Council Setting%0a%3c Becoming the norm is a bitch, becoming the institution is even worse. The Free Council in Savannah is in an odd position; they appear to be in charge without having to sit in the big chair. The situation is convoluted to say the least, but it is a truth.%0a%3c %0a%3c Five years ago a pogrom against the Guardians of the Veil was laid at the Hierarch’s feet. Titus, a Silver Ladder, was run out of town under accusations of supporting the Abyss, the Seers, and about anyone else the Consilium could blame for the death of so many awakened. The apostate population was culled, even the Free Council wanted blood in those days. Afterwards the Consilium was wrecked, one order was decimated, and another was in shambles. It was at this time that -Heron,- the head of the Assembly in Savannah, was offered the Hierarch’s  position by the ranking members of the Mysterium. The Arrow didn’t want the spot, the Silver Ladder was stained by Titus and the accusations against him and the Guardians were in Shambles. %0a%3c %0a%3c In what can only be described as a “dick” move, ‘‘Heron’’ instead suggested that the Guardians would be safest if one of their members was Hierarch. In short, ‘‘Heron’’ sidestepped direct responsibility to the Consilium and forced a Guardian into a position they didn’t want. It was a coup, a Mask was now, in -Heron’s- mind, and impotent figurehead that had to stay in front of the eyes of the Consilium at all order when they had to run the Consilium.  ‘‘Heron’’ proved  himself to be an astute politician, one capable of leading without needing a title to do it and this act was just the beginning.%0a%3c %0a%3c In the last five years ‘‘Heron’’ has made sure that there is enough Consilium business to keep the masks weak in physical power. The Silver Ladder, yeah, they are recovering, but it is slow. The Ladder’s pride took the brunt of the damage and ‘‘Heron’’ is sometimes liberal in reminding the Magisters about this.  Following -Heron’s- lead, the Free Council took the opportunity to show the Ladder that living in the past, or what the Libertines see as the past, was not the way to go. %0a%3c %0a%3c How did they show the Silver Ladder that the old ways didn’t work, well, they stepped in and operated the Consilium how they thought it should be ran. In doing this they, the Free Council, became the institution; a shift they did not see coming and were, at first, not prepared to adapt to.  The Mysterium was not dabbling in politics, busy with their own pursuits,  and the Arrows were their normal quiet self under the leadership of ‘‘Kreig’’.  Suddenly the Free Council was doing all the leg work in the Consilium, a role that they had to take to prove the old ways were wrong and, initially, they seemed to be up to the task. There was some change, but over the course of the last five years the Libertines find themselves following the old methods, in regards to the Consilium, instead of forging new methods. To some this was lazy, to others it was what was needed. The Free Council seemed to lose some of its vision and there has been talk that ‘‘Heron’’ spends too much time resting on his laurels.%0a%3c %0a%3c The current state for the Free Council is the natural state of the Free Council, one of change, a flux caught in the moment right before it sparks. The Free Council has made some change happen, but they have also fallen into old habits. They are not the outcast order, they are not the young upstarts. Here in Savannah they are the institution, not as an Assembly for all Awakened, but as the current backbone of the Consilium. There are perks, the Free Council has been able to keep the Guardians in check, the Silver Ladder cowed and appear to have little in the way of opposition from the Arrows and the Mysterium. The problem, as some see it, is that the Free Council has a lot of what it wants… and no idea what to do with it. ‘‘Heron’’ leads the Free Council, but does not lead the Consilium. The work supporting the Consilium and the Awakened has fallen to the rank and file. %0a%3c %0a%3c It is hard to say if the revolution has ended, or if it is just beginning. The Consilium functions, the Assembly is still intact, though it is a majority of the Consilium now. And oddly enough, the Hierarch, a Guardian of the Veil has never stopped the Free Council from trying to make change, at times even supporting the Libertine cause and ideals. Strange times that, times that make many libertine question, “What’s next?”%0a%3c %0a%3c  [--%25color=#365776%25[[#top| Back to top]]--]%0a%3c %0a%3c [[#FC-OS]]%0a%3c !!!Free Council Order Status%0a%3c Make sure you have taken a look at the status primer as it will give you the overview for the entire venue. This portion will be broken down into two distinct parts. The status in the order and the status in the Consilium:%0a%3c %0a%3c To gain status in the order begins with what is covered in the status primer. Forward the goals of the Free Council. Look to make change, look to forward the Order’s goals and mandates. Guide the Pentacle and show that the past was just that, the past, and the future is what will define the Awakened as a people.  Look to control resources that will help herald in the future, look to enact change in law, in procedure that affects and benefits the Pentacle. Fighting from within and without will make change.  %0a%3c %0a%3c Defending the order from subversion, from damaging rhetoric will help gain status. Becoming an example of what is to come, leading the change, these are ways to gain status.. Another way is to forward your understanding of the Free Council and its ways. In the Free Council supplement there are core ideals called the Three Tenants: (not to be confused with an actor who plays a Doctor.)%0a%3c %0a%3c  [--%25color=#365776%25[[#top| Back to top]]--]%0a%3c %0a%3c [[#FC-CS]]%0a%3c !!!Free Councilors and Consilium Status%0a%3c A Free Councilor can gain status in the Consilium by performing Consilium required tasks, many of which will parallel tasks assigned by the order. There are easy ways for the common Libertine to rise in some stature, and forwarding the goals and earning Consilium status can be parlayed into order status.. Taking active roles in the Consilium is an easy path for a Libertine, some of these roles can include Councilor or Provost to a cabal, the position of Sentinel or of Herald. Also, for enterprising players the character could learn from another order, taking order specific titles (such as the Silver Ladder Factotum [lawyer of the Lex]) as a way to represent the adaptability of the Free Council as an order. The positions of the Consilium and of other order will be discussed in other posts.

If you have the book you are willing to read the information there, but more importantly, you will define these concepts in your character’s terms. When looking to advance you will be required to understand and define what these ideals mean in game for you. It will take a little bit of writing, but you do not have to write a novella. Also, you will not have to write on each subject, when looking to advance you will be given a selection of these ideals and you need to format them in a way that is congruent to how you have been playing your character. Status will not just be handed out because you want to rise in rank, there is some work to do.%0a%3c %0a%3c  [--%25color=#365776%25[[#top| Back to top]]--]%0a%3c %0a%3c [[#FC-Pos]]%0a%3c !!!Positions in the Free Council%0a%3c :Status -1 -Voter- The ground floor of the Libertines, the voter is the rank and file. Expected to follow company policy, the Voter could be asked to jump through hoops before gaining this status, but once they are established, they serve to strengthen the Libertines by helping guide the order though their participation in the Assembly.%0a%3c Status 1-3- Emissary- Starting as a 1 dot status, the emissary is a common position within the Free Council. Like internal heralds, the emissary is a form of contact between estranged Consili and Free Council Assemblies. %0a%3c  %0a%3c :Status 1-3 Minutemen: These are the martial arm of the Free Council, those who are willing to fight, even die, for the cause. They serve the Assembly, and also can gain this status by fighting for a Consilium. To become a minuteman, the Voter must volunteer, and then they are considered in service to the Assembly in a military. Some would also say policemen.%0a%3c %0a%3c :Status 1-5 Syndic: Politicians to the core, these are the voice and the fire in the Free Council.  Equal parts charisma and chutzpah, these are the best and the worst of the free Council. They can lead, they can backstab, and they are a vocal piece of the free council that pushes the assembly, and all those around them, for whatever ideal they serve. They can rise to lead assemblies to greatness… or ruin.%0a%3c %0a%3c :Status 2 Host: Becoming a host shows that a voter has displayed some form of organization ability. Whether is providing safe haven for meetings, or making sure everyone attends meetings, the host is the grass-roots organizer that provides the backbone for the organization of the order.%0a%3c %0a%3c :Status 2-4 Letter Carrier: Like an Emissary the Letter Carrier is a type of emissary, though, there is a bit more to this position than the other. First, the letter carrier is known to travel abroad, second the letter carrier volunteers to have the memory altered with arcana so that they do not know what it is that they carry. A dedicated role, this is not used as much as it once was. Odd, to note, that a libertine would be willing to sacrifice a personal freedom to perform this task, but it does happen.%0a%3c %0a%3c :Status 2-4 Citizen Agent: These Libertines are more than Minutemen, they are the agents-provocateur, the spies and then covert operatives of the Assembly.  In an order with truth and openness as part of its bylines, the Citizen Agent is often hidden, unannounced in their role and their importance. They often answer to a select few of ranking Libertines in an area, sometimes only one.%0a%3c %0a%3c :Status 3-5 Strategos:Leaders of focus groups, this sums up the position quickly. Generals, politicians, statesmen and women. The strategos is a hard earned position that often times leads an assembly or represents the libertines in a Consilium. The problem is that outside of the area of expertise they are limited in their influence. A paper tiger or a powerful figure: The strategos is often as powerful as perception of their position allows them.%0a%3c %0a%3c  [--%25color=#365776%25[[#top| Back to top]]--]%0a%3c %0a%3c  [[#Guardians of the Veil]]%0a%3c !!Guardians of the Veil%0a%3c %25lfloat text-align=center margin-top=5px margin-right=15px margin-bottom=5px margin-left=0px%25http://wantonwicked.gamingsandbox.com/wiki/images/mta/symbols/mta_logo_gov.png%0a%3c The war is always easiest when you know who your enemies are; the truth is simplest when fact is more blatant than fiction. It is easy to lead when the path is clear, easy to see the future when the past is unobscured. For the Guardians of the Veil there is no easy, there is no way that they walk that is not riddled with sacrifice and loss. Lies, deceits, half-truths and shadows are the currency of the Guardians. The fight a war against their own, their enemies are often found inside the very Pentacle they protect. The Guardians protect magic, the Awakened, and they also protect the sleeping world from the Awakened world. When Mages prey upon the sleeping world the Guardians act, when mortal unearth an ancient tome, again they must act. More than the dream police or the supernal FBI, the Guardians believe, with a religious fervor, that their role is to make a better world. %0a%3c %0a%3c While they are not the awakened police, per say, they are similar to an IAD, an Internal Affairs Division. They stop Awakened from affecting the mortal world in supernal manners. Whether the vulgar magic, a particular dislike of Guardians because of their dogmatic beliefs, used by a new Free Councilors, or the abuse of sleepwalkers by a Silver Ladder Cryptopoly, the guardians look to uncover the wrongs committed by the Awakened so that they cannot be repeated. Are the Guardian’s their brothers’ keepers? Yes and no, they sacrifice for the Pentacle because while they believe the Awakened must herald in a new age, Guardians know they cannot lead. So they seek to defend, as best they can in manners that they can, so that those who do lead, lead  justly. Their perception, like any other order, can be skewed based on the leadership of the order. %0a%3c %0a%3c If this were not enough to cast a shadow of doubt and insecurity when dealing with the Guardians, then their almost cult-like fanaticism and structure is the proverbial nail in their supernal coffin. The order itself believes in prophecy and in the coming of a new age, an age that they, in their service and their suffering, herald into being. It is during this time that the sins of the Guardians will be judged, will ways equal means, or will all the suffering be for naught as the Guardians are once again considered the Pariah of the Awakened. There is no easy answer, there is no simple truth. The Guardians keep their secrets, hiding their motivations deep and dark, for every truth that is uncovered about the order a half dozen lies are used to swaddle the information until there is nothing left to believe.%0a%3c %0a%3c Guardians utilize many tactics that mirror the Seers of the Throne, extensively using mortals, sleepwalkers and sleepers alike. A labyrinth is as complex as a Silver Ladder Cryptopoly and twice and dangerous. Here the cults rise and fall, the sins of a few are dispersed to the many, and sometimes, there is a required payment for these sins. Sometimes, the only thing on the menu is the Kool-Aid and there is no choice but to drink.%0a%3c %0a%3c  [--%25color=#365776%25[[#top| Back to top]]--]%0a%3c %0a%3c [[#Guardians of the Veil-P]]%0a%3c !!!Playing a Guardian of the Veil%0a%3c The Guardians here are in a tight spot, everything they do is done in the full view of the Consilium, or, so they say. The Hierarch, a Guardian himself, was forced into the position, one that any Guardian would gladly avoid. But luckily, the Hierarch knows how to play the game, and has made it so that when the Guardians press a case, they win. It has taken some work, but this is not a city where the Guardians try to infiltrate the other orders, or the Seers, The lines are clearly drawn and posted on the Map… almost as if taunting some enemy to strike, to make a … mistake.%0a%3c %0a%3c To play a Guardian you are going to have to be able to follow the tenants, the thesis of the Guardians of the Veil while also balancing a very public persona. Your masques, should you choose to utilize them, should be the best face forward so that the Consilium thinks that the Guardians are cornered, and cowed. It will be hard to do, but only the brave can truly understand sacrifice and reward for that suffering.%0a%3c %0a%3c  [--%25color=#365776%25[[#top| Back to top]]--]%0a%3c %0a%3c [[#Guardians of the Veil-S]]%0a%3c !!!Guardians of the Veil Setting%0a%3c The chosen few, the survivors, the Guardians of the Veil still exist in Savannah.  The scars are faded, five years will do that, but the memories are still there hidden behind the eyes. ‘‘Siafu’’ still carries the Hierarch’s title, a title she never sought but now tends to as seriously as can be expected. She refuses to sit down when the Consilium is convened; so it is hard to say she holds that chair. Even now, with all that has been done, all thrones are false. Her voice echoes when she speaks, addressing the present and the past, part of her still lost in events that happened half a decade ago. She and her lieutenant, ‘’Moraceae’’,  are among the handful that survived the pogrom against the Guardians, the few that remember a week’s worth of terror and loss. Some have fled, no longer willing to live in Savannah, others have retreated, sealing themselves away so that their demons do not affect others.  Then there are those that died as they had lived, as Guardians of the Veil in the war against the Lie and the Abyss.%0a%3c %0a%3c ‘‘Siafu’’ never asked to be the Hierarch, no, that was a political machination orchestrated by -Heron. - She knows this, but she does not hold it against -Heron, - he does not realize that sacrifice is needed to protect the awakened, the sleepers, and those caught in between. Free Councilors rarely understand sacrifice without martyrdom; sometimes one just has to act without other’s watching.  ‘‘Siafu’’ understands that, understands sacrifice; this is what Guardians do. ‘‘Siafu’s’’ sacrifice is that she must lead the Consilium, for now, as best she can in a role that any Guardian would normally avoid. She understands the price she must pay for being a survivor, for protecting those who remain, and she pays it with quiet service.%0a%3c %0a%3c Savannah once held a large contingent of Guardians that operated, not so much with impunity, but with consistency. These were not the shadowy figures that existed in the rumors and myths of other Consili, these were active Awakened who worked in and outside of the Consilium. The Guardians were respected, in a way, by the other orders. They followed the Lex, they performed their duties, and for the most part, they worked outside of the city when they were needed. Their reputation followed them, of course, but they did their best not to live up to the accusations normally reserved for Guardians. %0a%3c %0a%3c Now Savannah has a smaller population of Guardians than before, and their public mask has been forced because of the other orders. The Guardians, with ‘‘Siafu’’ as their example, have become adepts at following the rules. Every ‘t” is crossed; every “I” is dotted. They follow the Lex, some becoming quite skilled at its interpretation and application. Before -Titus,- of the Silver Ladder, was accused of collusion with the enemies of the pentacle,  he had mandated that Apostates would be banned from Savannah, holding these unknown members of Awakened society accountable for much of what had happened. Oddly enough, ‘‘Siafu’’ rescinded this mandate, allow Apostates back into the city. Her comment on why she allowed the Apostates back into Savannah as a cryptic, “They have made their sacrifice.” %0a%3c %0a%3c The Guardians survive, tenacious and dedicated, they believe in ‘‘Siafu’’ and her leadership. They trust in ‘‘Moraceae’’ and his hand as ‘’Siafu’s’’ lieutenant. The Guardians are willing to sacrifice so that others will be free from the lie, they know that their cause, no matter what others think, is just, and that they will be judged for their actions. Their relationship with the other orders is odd at the best. With the ladder they have a bond built from shame and rebuilding. With the Arrows they receive a quiet admiration for those who survive and continue to fight. The Free Council is haughty, self-stylizing themselves as victors who now can act without their mythic threat of the Guardians hanging above them. The Free Council feels it has this freedom, and for some reason they now act more like a traditional Diamond order. And then there is the Mysterium. No one can judge the relationship between the Guardians and Mysterium, there is a chasm between the two, one of polite détente reminiscent of the Cold War.%0a%3c %0a%3c  [--%25color=#365776%25[[#top| Back to top]]--]%0a%3c %0a%3c [[#Guardians of the Veil-S]]%0a%3c !!!Guardian Order Status%0a%3c Make sure you have taken a look at the status primer as it will give you the overview for the entire venue.

The status in the order and the status in the Consilium:%0a%3c %0a%3c To gain status in the order begins with what is covered in the status primer. Forward the goals of the Guardians of the Veil, do so in a manner that never implicates the order, never seems to cross the line. Learn the loopholes in the Lex, learn the ways to champion the cause of the order and then make it seem like it is done for the Consilium.%0a%3c Defending the order from attacks, take the war to the Seers without breaking the truce, and following the tenants of the order in the plain and open view of the Consilium without getting caught, these will increase your status and standing. Another way is to forward your understanding of the Guardians, and its ways. In the GOV supplement there are core ideals and these ideals are the basis of guardian thought.

The trick, then, to call it that, is giving a Consilium no choice but to recognize the worth, and the value, of a Guardian as a member of the Consilium. By performing Consilium required tasks, to the very letter, Guardians can rise to some measure of status in a Consilium. The Consilium can detest a Guardian for their perceived work, but without proof, they egalitarian nature means the a Consilium must reward those who prove their worth.. For enterprising players, a character could learn from another order, in clear view of the Consilium, which would be very un-Guardian behavior.%0a%3c %0a%3c  [--%25color=#365776%25[[#top| Back to top]]--]%0a%3c %0a%3c [[#Guardians of the Veil-B]]%0a%3c !!!Beliefs of the Guardians of the Veil%0a%3c Necessary Secrets and Sins%0a%3c 	Paradox strengthens the Abyss as punishment for Pride.%0a%3c 	Sins for a Just End grant Wisdom to the Awakened%0a%3c Merit Must Guide the Fallen World%0a%3c The Esoteric Tenets:%0a%3c 	All Thrones are False all Souls are Flawed%0a%3c 	There is a Secret Hierarchy of Souls%0a%3c 	The Hieromagus will fulfill the Diamond Wheel%0a%3c Praxis: The Law of the Mask%0a%3c 	Learning to Remember%0a%3c 	Parables and Koans%0a%3c 	Oral Histories and Prophecies%0a%3c The Culture of Secrecy%0a%3c 	Anonymity and Reticence%0a%3c 	Habitual Surveillance%0a%3c 	Levels of Trust%0a%3c The Divine Thread%0a%3c 	Defend the Awakened%0a%3c 	Protect the Sanctity of Magic%0a%3c 	Weaken the Enemies of Atlantis%0a%3c 	Prepare the Way for the Hieromagus%0a%3c %0a%3c You will notice I did not add what each of these means.

They are to develop, as their name suggests, cults that follow the doctrine of an Epopt. These members of the Guardians of the Veil are tasked with the creation of Labyrinths, secret societies and occult groups that follow whatever mandate is set forth by the Guardians of the Veil. They are active, leaders from the shadow even as their Silver Ladder counterparts lead from the pulpit. They lie, they exaggerate or depreciate the words of others. They are confidants, best friends and dangerous enemies. Successful creation of a labyrinth does not always end for the Awakening of its members, sometimes it ends with their deaths.%0a%3c %0a%3c :Status 1 Emissary: The order appointed herald of sorts; the emissary is meant to be a tool of communication between the Guardians of the Veil and other orders. Unlike its Consilium counterpart, the Emissary has been known to use blackmail, threats, and other nefarious means to communicate the wishes of the Guardians to other Awakened. Working both within, and outside of the order, it is the emissary that often relays messages from the Epopt to Cultors, though their status is the same, the message comes from on high and the words are best when followed.%0a%3c %0a%3c :Status 2 Interfector:It is at this level of status that the Guardians earn the ire of this rest of the awakened. Torturers, murderers and assassins the Interfector position is the blood hand of the Guardians of the Veil. Used carefully, and not always acknowledge by the Consilium which supports the Guardians, the Interfector plays the role of the evil that must be done. Occasionally, however, it is the Interfectors who must bear the brunt of the anger of the Consilium, the position is not for the weak of heart. They are not blind in their devotion, they must balance their need with the need of the Consilium and the Guardians of the Veil, but when they are called upon they must be able to act without flinching.%0a%3c %0a%3c :Status 3 Susceptor:The Specialists of the Guardians, the Susceptor position is one fraught with perils unlike the other positions. Where Interfectors may be used as scapegoats and occasional object lessons Susceptors do not have the shielding influence of the Guardians to protect them. They are often the spies, the deep agents focused on a specific goal. They often must work alone, but their work is important to the Guardian cause.%0a%3c %0a%3c :Status 4 Epopt: Unlike a totalitarian ruler that one might expect, the Epopt is a politician and a communicator. The role of the Cultor has a certain need for independence and it is the job of the Epopt to organize these various independent factions so that they work together. They must balance the ebb and the flow of politics within the Consilium so that while everyone may suspect the Guardians of misdoings, they have no proof. Of all the members of the Guardians, it is the Epopt who knows the majority of the secrets of the Guardians; therefore, they are the most protected.%0a%3c %0a%3c  [--%25color=#365776%25[[#top| Back to top]]--]%0a%3c %0a%3c [[#TM]]%0a%3c !!The Mysterium%0a%3c %25lfloat text-align=center margin-top=5px margin-right=15px margin-bottom=5px margin-left=0px%25http://wantonwicked.gamingsandbox.com/wiki/images/mta/symbols/mta_logo_m.png%0a%3c The days of pulp, of action and adventure in an idealized time, live large and strong in the minds of the sleepers and awakening does not change the draw to the fantastic. Stories about quests, of plumbing hidden depths, the search for ancient lore and more importantly, treasure, are a favorite escape. The silver screen has made Quartermain, O’Connell and Carnahan, Croft and Jones names that invoke images of fedora’s and dusty boots, whips and Wesley revolvers,  temples in jungles, and the ever present threat of traps, animals and the occasional Nazi. This is the glamorous ideal of the Mysterium, the dashing adventurer off to secure ancient relics of Atlantis before they fall into the hands of an enemy. The flip side is the spidery scribe dipping an archaic quill into a well of India ink before they laboriously transcribe a tome that will never make the New York Best Sellers list. Again, the image is vivid; the skeletal like hands, the drawn pale skin, and the knowledge hidden behind blank eyes that have seen and read too much. The Mysterium is both, and neither, it is an order dedicated to the supernal, to the secrets hidden within, and the understanding that knowledge is power, it should be hidden wisely.%0a%3c %0a%3c The Mysterium, like the Adamantine Arrow, the Guardians of the Veil and the Silver Ladder trace their roots to Atlantis, to a time before the sundering of the realms. Before the celestial ladder was shattered and the Awakened were driven from their flawed Utopia, the Mysterium questioned, they researched and experimented with the arcane, the sublime and the supernal. In this their role has not changed, they still seek the mysteries, the answers, and the additional questions that their research provokes. But, the Mysterium has evolved; they now protect the secrets of the Supernal as much as the Guardians of the Veil. They covet relics of the past; they seek to collect the fragments of a long forgotten time. And, unknown to most orders, what the Mysterium cannot collect they are often times willing to destroy.  For every curator in the Mysterium there is also a member who is willing to be a thief, a procurer of goods in legal and illegal manners. Some members wear the façade of the scholar while also being a sometimes assassin; the pen truly becomes mightier than the sword with these members. %0a%3c %0a%3c There are those in the Mysterium who are completely content to avoid politics, to ponder a question, or a series of thoughts, until they find an enlightenment that they can share with others. Others are as dangerous in the political arts as any of the other orders.  Some stay quiet, recluses and hermits, they shun contact with others because their magic is their art and they are dedicated in protecting their art. There are the researchers and supernal scientists practicing forgotten rituals and rites, there are the laymen and women who do what needs to be done to keep the Order organized and functioning. The Mysterium, like the other orders, is everything said about it, and nothing. Their secrets are well kept, well hidden. Their practices are steeped in tradition and history, they are the lore masters and keepers of history, always with an eye to finding hidden truths even as they hide other information for their own safe keeping.%0a%3c %0a%3c  [--%25color=#365776%25[[#top| Back to top]]--]%0a%3c %0a%3c [[#TM-P]]%0a%3c !!!Playing a Mysterium%0a%3c The Mysties are not always super-secret bookworms that speak in riddles and Walken-esque tangents. They are like any other order, diverse and driven with a combination of order and personal goals. They have an interest in knowledge that is shared, but its interpretation is a personal one. The Mysterium is organized, very organized as one might suspect. Positions carry weight, and the access to further mysteries is strictly governed. Those who perform are rewarded, but with each reward come more responsibility, and more questions. The Mysterium seeks… that is the best way to say it. They seek, but what they seek is just part of the secret of being a member of the Mysterium.%0a%3c %0a%3c It is safe to say that mental skills are highly valued by the Mysterium. But that is just a little too easy. The ability to communicate is balanced with the ability to research. Patience is more than a virtue with the Mysterium, it is a requirement. Many of the younger members take time in learning this skill, but it is one that will serve them well during their time as a Mystie.  Something the Mysterium player must remember is that not everyone will want to question, want to look for the hidden secret or the obscure fact. During these times it comes down to those Mysterium members who are strong enough to influence others to assert themselves. Mysterium member must have the potential to lead, especially in times where their skills are the best use to the party. They need to know when silence and reserve must be put on the shelf and action must occur. Those are the Mysterium characters that will catch the eyes of others, both inside and outside of their orders.%0a%3c %0a%3c  [--%25color=#365776%25[[#top| Back to top]]--]%0a%3c %0a%3c [[#TM-S]]%0a%3c !!!Mysterium Setting%0a%3c The Mysterium waits, patiently, watching all that happens and recording what needs to be remembered. Well, what they deem needs to be remembered might be a better way of saying it. The Order has been an institution in Savannah, it is not exactly sure if it was the Mysterium or the Adamantine Arrow that first sought out the area now known as Savannah. If ‘‘Hattan’’ was not a Mysterium then it was those member of the Mysterium  arriving to study his work, and staying to complete  their  own work, that has made this Order  the longest active member of the Diamond in Savannah. %0a%3c %0a%3c During the trouble five years ago, it was ‘’Aislin’’, Curator and Senior Daduchos, who accused, and provided evidence against, ‘‘Titus’’ of the Silver Ladder. The then Hierarch was accused of aiding those forces that had all but destroyed the Guardians of the Veil. It was also ‘‘Aislin’’ who offered the seat of the Hierarch to the Free Council’s ‘‘Heron’’ instead of to the then hierophant ‘’Mariannas’’. What some believed was soon to be a schism within the Mysterium ended up becoming a cliché when ‘‘Mariannas’’ announced his retirement before subsequently vanishing from Savannah. It was… of course, a Mystery, and no one in then order seemed to know why ‘’Mariannas’’ retired as he did. %0a%3c %0a%3c When ‘‘Heron’’ suggested ‘‘Siafu’’ for the position of Hierarch it was ‘‘Aislin’’ who supported the idea without a pause even as she assumed the now vacant hierophant’s position within the Mysterium. If there was dissention or grumbling, it was never voiced, the Mysterium did not seem to miss a beat as a; war ended, one Hierarch was sacked and another installed and the leadership of their Order changed hands in the space of hours. The Mysterium displayed its ability to play politics, ‘‘Aislin’’ appeared to be a kingmaker in the mold of the Silver Ladder, but she did not push whatever agenda she had by suggesting -Heron.- Since that time ‘‘Aislin’’ has quietly supported the Hierarch, but the warmth between the two seems strained at best. Perhaps this is why the  Mysterium has preferred to let its councilors act in the interest of the Consilium instead of moving as an Order. %0a%3c %0a%3c The strongest bond the Mysterium has currently is with the Free Council, though that is not saying much. The Free Council spent some time trying to prove their self-stylized manner of an Assembly nee Consilium was correct, only to find out the amount of work it took to balance out the different orders. The Mysterium has never actually said, “ We told you so,” but the looks and the occasional comment tell the true story. With the Silver Ladder, there is a cold peace, the ousting of ‘‘Titus’’ and the besmirching of the Silver Ladder’s pride, even for the “right” reasons has strained relations between the orders. The Mysterium and the Guardians of the Veil have never been close, those who keep secrets tend to have a hard time making friends with others who keep secrets. Finally, the relationship with the Arrow is, odd at best. ‘‘Kreig’’ and ‘‘Aislin’’ do not dislike one another, nor do they like one another, there is some wedge between the order, a wedge neither side is willing to speak on.%0a%3c %0a%3c For now the Mysterium works on various projects, most of which are hidden away from the prying eyes of other awakened. Some projects are even obfuscated from members within the order, their secret reserved for those who are needed for their abilities. This is, of course, the nature of the Mysterium, the nature of an order built around the concepts of information and knowledge. Projects aside, the Savannah Mysterium is rumored as having one of the greatest vaults of items, artifacts, and pieces of knowledge on the Eastern Seaboard. The Athenaeum supposedly boasts a treasure trove hidden away and moderated by curators and acquisitors, sometimes growing, being traded with others for different relics. The Mysterium members stay busy, and are often known to develop some impressive frequent flyer miles. And then there is also rumor that there has been a break through on -Hattan’s- project, a deciphering of purpose and meaning that will change the face of the awakened landscape. %0a%3c %0a%3c  [--%25color=#365776%25[[#top| Back to top]]--]%0a%3c %0a%3c [[#TM-OS]]%0a%3c !!!Mysterium Order Status%0a%3c Make sure you have taken a look at the status primer as it will give you the overview for the entire venue. This portion will be broken down into two distinct parts. The status in the order and the status in the Consilium:%0a%3c %0a%3c To gain status in the order begins with what is covered in the status primer. Forward the goals of the Mysterium . Seek the hidden and the unknown, solve the mysteries and puzzles presented to you. Forward the will of the order in the Consilium and deflect the attention of others when they seek to gauge the strength of the Mysterium. The Mysterium follows several thesis, and expanding your understanding of them will help in your quest to gain status in the order.%0a%3c %0a%3c  [--%25color=#365776%25[[#top| Back to top]]--]%0a%3c %0a%3c [[#TM-CS]]%0a%3c !!!Mysterium and Consilium Status%0a%3c A Mysterium member can gain status in the Consilium by performing Consilium required tasks, many of which will parallel tasks assigned by the order. Providing information to the Consilium, as allowed by the order, serving in Consilium Positions, forwarding the goals of the Consilium, these are all ways a Mysterium member might gain status. %0a%3c %0a%3c  [--%25color=#365776%25[[#top| Back to top]]--]%0a%3c %0a%3c [[#TM-T]]%0a%3c !!!Thesis of the Mysterium%0a%3c Thesis :  Knowledge is Power%0a%3c %0a%3c Thesis : Knowledge Must be Preserved%0a%3c 	Pancryptia%0a%3c 	Academia and the Structure of the Lie%0a%3c 	%0a%3c Thesis: Knowledge has a Price%0a%3c 	Amorality%0a%3c 	Ordeals%0a%3c 	Authority%0a%3c %0a%3c Thesis:  The Corpus Mysterium%0a%3c 	Magic is Alive%0a%3c 	The Living History%0a%3c The Living Mystery%0a%3c 	The Mythic Corpus%0a%3c 		%0a%3c You will notice I did not add what each of these means. If you have the book you are willing to read the information there, but more importantly, you will define these concepts in your character’s terms. When looking to advance you will be required to understand and define what these ideals mean in game for you. It will take a little bit of writing, but you do not have to write a novella. Also, you will not have to write on each subject, when looking to advance you will be given a selection of these ideals and you need to format them in a way that is congruent to how you have been playing your character. Status will not just be handed out because you want to rise in rank, there is some work to do.%0a%3c %0a%3c  [--%25color=#365776%25[[#top| Back to top]]--]%0a%3c %0a%3c [[#TM-Pos]]%0a%3c !!!Positions in the Mysterium%0a%3c :Status 0-1 Neokoros: Literally those who sweep the temple, These are the newest members of the Mysterium, the true rank and file. Sleepwalkers can attain this rank and prepare themselves for the future.%0a%3c %0a%3c :Status 1 Senior Neokoros: Those who have not found specific roles within the Mysterium still have a value as the Senior Neokoros. They guide the initiates and the sleepwalkers, ready to advance themselves and the Mysterium they serve.%0a%3c %0a%3c :Status 1 Acquisitor:It's dangerous work, dirty work, but it is a popular position, These are your tomb raiders, your Indian Jones’s. These are the Mysterium members willing to travel, willing to throw their bodies and minds on the line in the search for artifact and relic, for tome and for knowledge. Some are thieves, others are called worse, but their role is clear, first dibs on whatever they find.%0a%3c %0a%3c :Status 1 Censor: Imagine the Guardians of the Veil branch of the Mysterium. When the Acuqisitor is off pursuing fame and treasure it is the censor who must do what dirty work remains. Censors do just as their name suggests, they censor the use of dangerous artifacts and knowledge, procuring it, hiding it, and sometimes even destroying it. Whether it is a device, a page of forgotten lore, or a person, the censor must have the iron will and the belief that what they do is for the better of all awakened.%0a%3c %0a%3c :Status 2 Daduchos: Meaning “torch Bearer” the Daduchos is the rank of the teaching branch of the Mysterium. These are the Awakened who guide the Neokoros and the daily function in a Mysterium’s Caucus.  This rank must be attained before being considered for a Savant role.%0a%3c %0a%3c :Status 2 Savant: The true record keepers, the savants live in two worlds, the occult and the mundane, coalescing theories and studies and recording them as best they can. They catalogue, the write, but most importantly, a savant is required to remember /everything/ they do. This is a hard position to attain, harder still to keep as some information should never be remembered.%0a%3c %0a%3c :Status 3 Senior Daduchos: Before becoming a Curator a Mage must first attain Senior Daduchos. These are the Mysterium who are challenging myths, searching for more esoteric and hidden lore.%0a%3c %0a%3c :Status 3 Curator: A patient and learned individual, the Curator is often the respected advisor as well and the personnel manager of the Mysterium. They organize Athenaeums, they promote the Mysterium values both in and out of the order. They are active in the Consilium but avoid the normal power plays and overt signs of action. They are politicians, and at times, even warriors in the social arena.  At times they marshal resources, organize and arrange the troops, other times they wait, patiently, until they are needed.%0a%3c %0a%3c :Status 4-5 Hierophant: The head of the order, the vision and the focus of the Mysterium caucus. Representing the order to the Consilium, the Hierophant has mastered certain secrets, finding out that there is no end to the mysteries to be solved.%0a%3c %0a%3c  [--%25color=#365776%25[[#top| Back to top]]--]%0a%3c %0a%3c [[#SL]]%0a%3c !!The Silver Ladder%0a%3c %25lfloat text-align=center margin-top=5px margin-right=15px margin-bottom=5px margin-left=0px%25http://wantonwicked.gamingsandbox.com/wiki/images/mta/symbols/mta_logo_sl.png%0a%3c The politician, the activist, and the manic street preacher telling you the end is nigh. It could be the bullhorn in a crowd causing the mob to surge and swell  or a preacher standing above a congregation, every word spreading faith and devotion. The Silver Ladder is often thought of as the blue blood aristocracy of the Pentacle, but the truth is far different than the fiction. Some of the members of the Ladder claim a heritage lost in the time since Atlantis, but no Ladder living today can draw a direct pedigree back to the founding families of the ancient city. The role of the Silver Ladder is that of a leader of people, their role is that of service for the Awakened and the sleeping world.  They are the spreaders of vision, of counsel and the scions of those ancients who believed in action. For ages the Silver Ladder has been the backbone of the organization of the pentacle, before the Free Council existed, it was the Ladder who proliferated a vision of the future, the need to evolve, to adapt, and to lead the sleeping world to an Awakened nation. Even now, the members of the Ladder regularly find themselves in the roles of counselors for the wise and the leaders of the Awakened. %0a%3c %0a%3c Some Ladders lead in Battle, as dangerous and cunning as their Adamantine Arrow Counterparts, others lead through education, as wise and knowing as members of the Mysterium. Many would like to think of the Silver Ladder as little more than popinjays puffed up with self-importance, and sadly some Ladders will fit this bill, but to be a Silver Ladder one must have a confidence that, to some, boarders on arrogance. Self-assurance that their cause is right, that their purpose is just, this is a hallmark of a Silver Ladder. Some might call it hubris, a hubris that goes back prior to the forging of the celestial ladder that would be the doom on Atlantis. These naysayers are the opponents of the Silver Ladder not because of their own investment, they are antagonists fed on the propaganda and muddled history of the other orders and the non-believers. The Ladder call hubris a cowards ward, a thin façade that the Awakened who cannot lead, who cannot “do,” hide behind. %0a%3c %0a%3c Seen by many as the pretender kings or as elitist, the Silver Ladder is thought as an anachronistic organization, especially to those of the Free Council. However, it has been the mission of the Silver Ladder to guide the Awakened in their goal to tap into the supernal mysteries. The Silver Ladder fights to remember the past, not to dwell in it, a part that is often overlooked by other orders. A silver Ladder is aware of his or her Order’s pedigree, but understands that it is the acts of the Silver Ladder today that guide the future. Some lead from the Hierarch’s seat, others as trusted advisor of wizened councilor. The role of a Ladder is not easy, constantly challenged by what some call progress the modern Silver Ladder must be part statesman, part warrior, and part sage. The Ladder is not for the weak of heart, mind or soul.%0a%3c %0a%3c  [--%25color=#365776%25[[#top| Back to top]]--]%0a%3c %0a%3c [[#SL-P]]%0a%3c !!!Playing a Silver Ladder%0a%3c The ladder sometimes is thought of as the “invictus” ( for you pointy toof players) of the Mage game. Some people do try to play the Ladder in this manner, but that is limiting in many ways. Mages do not respond to the power of ancient families when they have the same amount of power themselves. Blue blood spills as fast are red and white collars can be toppled by blue. The silver Ladder should be the role of a leader, or of a trusted advisor. These characters are more than boardroom executives who move pieces on a phantasmal chessboard. The Silver Ladder rewards leading from the front, helming the course of the Awakened nation in the form of a Consilium or a Cabal as well as providing leadership and counsel to the mortals who still slumber. %0a%3c The skills for a Ladder will be varied,  but expression and the ability to communicate are key. Whether a scholar, or a preacher denouncing the sins of the flesh and alcohol on a campus, the Ladder character must be able to communicate. This is not to say there are not warriors among the Ladder, the warrior caste, for a lack of a better term, is versed in combat that could include sword or a pen. Sometimes more is done with a word or a signature than even an army could accomplish, and the Silver Ladder player should remember this. Ladders are meant to be dynamic individuals, with great risk comes great reward.%0a%3c %0a%3c  [--%25color=#365776%25[[#top| Back to top]]--]%0a%3c %0a%3c [[#SL-S]]%0a%3c !!!Silver Ladder Setting%0a%3c A punch drunk prize fighter clinging to the ropes , the ten count echoing in their ears, taking minutes, years to process as they struggle to stand once again. This is the Silver Ladder of Savannah. Their reign had been long, their reign had been great, too great, and then they paid a price. The decimation of a pentacle member was laid at their feet. Their leader, the leader of the city, of the Consilium was charged with aiding and abetting. Suddenly the losses of another Order became their burden, their Lament as the once bright star of the Magisters was run out of town and the order was left leaderless. That was the hubris, the price of folly and arrogance that was paid by the Silver Ladder. Their faith in ‘‘Titus’’ made them weak, made his brilliance a Panacea for all that would ail the order. Once he was gone, the remaining members of the order were left to fend for themselves. %0a%3c %0a%3c It took some time, but the order finally looked into the mirror and remembered what it is. The Free Council, under ‘‘Heron’’ Was merciless for the first two years after the near destruction of the Guardians. Every mistake made by the Ladder was a reminder of ‘‘Titus’’ and his failure, the Ladder was hammered in the Consilium, its pride continually shattered as a price for their failure. The Free Council became the institution and ‘‘Heron’’ appeared to gloat during his greatest triumph.%0a%3c %0a%3c Then there was change. A new Ladder entered the city three years ago, ‘’Alsace’’, Lictor and Factotum of the Silver Ladder, she arrived like acanthi sometimes do, at exactly the right time. She engaged ‘‘Heron’’ openly, arguing the Lex, pointing out that she was not part of the Consilium during the troubles, and that the law was blind to the orders, it was written for all Awakened, all members of the pentacle. ‘‘Heron’’ found himself having to work against this Ladder and the lambasting of the Silver Ladder, and the constant reminder of the near destruction waned against this new bastion, one who could play politics with a silver tongue or a hidden knife.%0a%3c %0a%3c With ‘‘Alsace’’ drawing the attention of the Consilium, primarily the Free Council, to herself, Claviger ‘‘Decimus’’ began the reorganization of the Silver Ladder. It was true, they had relied on ‘‘Titus’’ too much, put all their supernal eggs in one basket. Their cryptopolies had been shattered and had dispersed in the two years since ‘‘Titus’’ left. Some saw this as a sign that ‘‘Titus’’ truly was deserving of the accusations against him, other saw it as the scattering of evidence of his innocence. Whatever it was the ladder regrouped, they rebuilt, and now their toes are dug into the ground and they are ready to push back into the Consilium, to retake their place. The Free Council’s dream of assembly didn’t work, the Consilium remains a Consilium, and it is a playing field that the Silver Ladder can finally level, perhaps erasing the stain left on their name.%0a%3c %0a%3c Right now the Ladder is coldest with the Free Council, but there should be no surprise. The Free Council has adopted the Hubris Mantle, treating their victory by continuously reminding the vanquished of their mistake. Their day will come, the scales will be balanced, and all debts will be paid. The relationship with the arrow is interesting. It is not warm, it is not cold., ‘‘Kreig’’ does not appear to share in the joy ‘‘Heron’’ has had in tormenting the Ladder, but he has not supported them either. Perhaps he is watching to see if they are willing to stand back up on their own two feet, if so, the attitude might change. With the Mysterium, the Ladder holds a silent grudge. It was ‘‘Aislin’’ who named ‘‘Titus’’ as a conspirator, but the evidence was never clear, there was no trial, for a moment the Lex was forgotten and passions swept through the Consilium, something has never set right because of that. And then, with the Guardians of the Veil… it is interesting, for orders that most often come to political blows the Guardians of the Veil has left the ladder be, ‘‘Siafu’’ does not say much in most cases, but says even less about the Ladder, yet the Guardians of the Veil have not stopped any progress made by the Ladder even when they had opportunity to do so.%0a%3c %0a%3c The Ladder is crawling up the ropes, bloodied but unbowed. Now is the time that they shake off the rust and the ringing in their ears as they step back into the fight. They will learn how string they are when the next punch lands.%0a%3c %0a%3c  [--%25color=#365776%25[[#top| Back to top]]--]%0a%3c %0a%3c [[#SL-OS]]%0a%3c !!!Silver Ladder Order Status%0a%3c Make sure you have taken a look at the status primer as it will give you the overview for the entire venue. This portion will be broken down into two distinct parts. The status in the order and the status in the Consilium:%0a%3c %0a%3c To gain status in the order begins with what is covered in the status primer. Forward the goals of the Silver Ladder whether in the Consilium or the mundane world. Lead from the front, by example, and forward understanding of the Silver Ladder precepts, order goals and mandates. Find and develop ways to encourage mortals to awaken, lead or guide mundane institutions to better themselves and push for their Supernal birthright. At times Silver Ladders will be judged on how they are perceived by others, for better and for worse. Sometimes antagonism is good when it causes positive action. %0a%3c %0a%3c Following the establishment of the Consilium, following the Lex Magica and making others see the wisdom of the Lex is also considered when thinking of status. The Ladder cannot be passive in their actions and expect others to notice. Sometimes a velvet glove must cover and iron fist. The Silver ladder follows what are called the Elemental precepts. They are broken down like so:%0a%3c %0a%3c  [--%25color=#365776%25[[#top| Back to top]]--]%0a%3c %0a%3c [[#SL-CS]]%0a%3c !!!Silver Ladders and Consilium Status%0a%3c A member of the Silver Ladder gains status in the Consilium by performing Consilium required tasks, many of which will parallel tasks assigned by the order. One of the most important investments of the Silver Ladder is the Lex Magica, so strengthening and defending the Lex is a consistent example of how the Silver Ladder can serve in the Consilium. Acting as Councilors, heads of Cabals, and supporting the Organization of the Consilium along more traditional lines is a way to gain status. Also serving in various positions or functions are ways for enterprising characters to gain status in the Consilium.%0a%3c %0a%3c  [--%25color=#365776%25[[#top| Back to top]]--]%0a%3c %0a%3c [[#SL-Pr]]%0a%3c !!!Precepts of the Silver Ladder%0a%3c The Diamond Precept:%0a%3c 	The Awakened are One Nation%0a%3c 	Enemies of Unity - those who are enemies of the Awakened Nation%0a%3c 	Hieraconis - The Nation yet to come%0a%3c The precept of Thunder:%0a%3c 	Imperium is the Right of Man%0a%3c 	The Stag, The Lion, The Sage - The roles of the Silver Ladder%0a%3c 	Inspiring Power%0a%3c The Precept of the Star%0a%3c 	The Silver Ladder is the Path To Victory%0a%3c 	Spirituality%0a%3c 	Law and Justice%0a%3c 	Government%0a%3c The Precept of Blood%0a%3c 	The Sleepers Follow%0a%3c 	Religion%0a%3c 	Politics%0a%3c 	Secret Societies%0a%3c %0a%3c %0a%3c  [--%25color=#365776%25[[#top| Back to top]]--]%0a%3c %0a%3c [[#SL-Pos]]%0a%3c !!!Positions in the Silver Ladder%0a%3c :Status 0-1 Acolyte: The initiated and the new. These members of the Silver Ladder have begun their elemental pilgrimage and they stand ready to take the steps that will lead them to a greater understanding of themselves. To attain status 1 an Acolyte should have decided which precept they are going to follow and then they will begin to develop their relationships inside and outside of the Ladder.%0a%3c %0a%3c :Status 2 Lictor, Factotum, Acolyte (Superior):The acolyte is still an acolyte with status two, though they have developed a reputation or some form of clout. They Silver Ladder ought to be beginning their cryptopoly by now, or focusing on other aspects of the Silver Ladder. These other aspects could be the Factotum position, a position covered in more depth (here.) The Factotum is a student and a specialist in the Lex Magica, they are often the ones who add amendments to a Consilium’s Lex and are sought after as advisors. The Lictor, which is a rare position is a travelling ladder who prosecutes the Lex in times of dire need. They have special exemptions regarding the Lex. Few Lictors are not also qualified Factotums. To gain the status of Lictor will take serious work in game, and one will need to have the Silver Ladder supplement to fully understand the character requirements.%0a%3c %0a%3c :Status 3 Claviger: The Claviger is a role that requires a character to put Order business and mandate before all else. They are expected to understand all of the elemental precepts and how they affect the Consilium and the mortal world. They are teachers, mentors and the guides to newly awakened Ladders. Often times Clavigers are the emissaries to the Consilium and other awakened when it is not expedient to use Heralds. These ambassador duties could include dealing with ghosts, spirits, and in the event of dealing with other supernatural creatures, it is the Claviger’s duties to forward the goals of the Silver Ladder.%0a%3c %0a%3c :Status 4 Deacon: The position of Deacon is actually a sacrifice, it is the suppressing of personal desire to plumb the Supernal mysteries to serve the Silver Ladder. Deacons define the role of an order in a city, and represent their city in larger congregations.  The Deacon is often a master in some way, but not always, sometimes it is a person of rare vision and dedication who can attain this role.%0a%3c %0a%3c Part of gaining status in the Silver Ladder is the formation of Cryptopolies. There will be a longer post on what these are, and what they might entail will take up its own post.%0a%3c %0a%3c  [--%25color=#365776%25[[#top| Back to top]]--]%0a%3c [[#MageOrdersEnd]]%0a---%0a> [[#Mage Orders]]%0a> [[#Mage OrdersEnd]]%0a> %0a> [[#Sleepwalkers]]%0a> [[#SleepwalkersEnd]]%0a> %0a> [[#Apostates]]%0a> [[#ApostatesEnd]]%0a> [[#Antagonists]]%0a> [[#AntagonistsEnd]]%0a> %0a> ----%0a> !!The Venue Content%0a> %0a> [[#HouseRules]]%0a> (:table border=0:)%0a> (:cellnr bgcolor=#004a80 align=center:)%0a> '''%25white%25Mage House Rules%25%25'''%0a> (:cellnr:)%0a> *...%0a

That is a good question, the core Mage: the Awakening and the various supplemental books give several different ideas and interpretations of what makes a Consilium. Individually they have their merits, and their flaws. In table-top terms, the Consilium is a collection NPCs that are allies and enemies of the players. The players, often formed into one cabal, are a self-formed bastion for and against the Consilium they exist in. In a chat setting, the Consilium has to be a little different.%0a%3c %0a%3c "The Goal: A chat Consilium has to be dynamic or a vital aspect of the game will wither and die. %0a%3c %0a%3c "The Consilium is the political framework as well as the arena itself. Here the opposite is true compared to the table-top Consilium. The storyteller may be running the hierarch, four Order heads in competition and cahoots with easily twice that number of councilors, heralds and sentinels. Here the players should outnumber the NPCs, so why do so many storytellers try to limit this? %0a%3c %0a%3c "Part of that is control, many storytellers believe that they can control the story and the setting by having a massive number of NPCs that are nebulously defined and exist in the shadows. I disagree, and I won’t do that. The venue will thrive because of player interaction and player action. It is for this reason that the Savannah Consilium will be player driven. It is not a perfect scenario, but it is much better than waiting for an NPC to get back to you on one matter or another. In this venue you will have multiple channels of communication, multiple players with clout and responsibilities that can work for or against you. In this you will not be relying on me as much as you will be role-playing with others, therefor, this is a winning scenario for me."%0a%3c %0a%3c %25block text-align=right%25—HunterV%0a%3c %0a%3c !!!Consilium History%0a%3c Five years.%0a%3c %0a%3c Five years and counting since Savannah’s Awakened were forced to accept that sanctum walls and good Southern manners were not as thick and strong as they once believed. Rebuilding is a slow process when the foundation is cracked; sometimes there are too many wounds and triage becomes the business of death, not the first step of healing. Odd, wounds that can’t be healed by time and by mind, by life or any combination of the above, terrify those who have forgotten what it means to feel, to live. %0a%3c %0a%3c However, Savannah has a history of surviving, a history of staying strong. Pounded by British and then American guns, surviving the advance of Sherman to the Atlantic, the city has seen blood run through its streets. It was only a matter of time until the blood spilt carried the legacy of Atlantis. The wise are resilient, resourceful, Scions of Ancient legacies and of stubborn Southern pride, they dug in, for five long years they shored up the walls, rebuilt the bastions, and forged anew a pentacle quenched in the lives of the lost. For a while their heads bowed but shoulders remained square, they have rebuilt, they have continued on their supernal paths and the Consilium remain intact. %0a%3c %0a%3c Now is the time of questioning, Is the Consilium strong once more, has it regained its stature and its spine, or is it just a façade covering a rotting core? Even to the Enchanters, the future is cloudy; there are more storms on the horizon. This is the testament of the culling, of the week that saw the world turn against the Consilium, against the wise, against one order in an effort to scatter its members in the dust. Too many had been safe for too long, something was ripe for change and everyone knew it.  The air was heavier, the storm season approached, the population of awakened began to swell, everyone saw the signs before them, they saw them and they ignored them. %0a%3c %0a%3c Nothing is more complete than denial, nothing makes a man or woman blind like the idealism they wish to see around them. That denial brought death and now memory is compounded by guilt. Everyone who remains is to blame, but who is accountable, no one knows. Five years have passed, five years of healing, of change. The scars are still raw, five years is a blink of an eye to some. The Slow mind numbing day-to-day routine doesn’t get rid of the itch, the constant reminder of failure make even the purest water taste bitter.%0a%3c %0a%3c Savannah’s Consilium exists like it once did and yet it is changed like never before. ''Siafu'', a Guardian of the Veil, holds the position of Hierarch. This was not a position attained  from a mad grab for power or devious machinations complete with shady deals and hidden promises. The Guardians, the two that remain from the events five years ago, found ''Siafu'' elevated to the role of Hierarch at the suggestion of ''Heron'' of the Free Council. ''Aislin'' of the Mysterium, in her own king-making bid to control the Mysterium, supported ''Heron'' even as she laid the damning, though controversial proof, at the feet of ''Titus'', the previous Hierarch and order head of the Silver Ladder. ''Titus'' was driven from the city, the Silver Ladder was leaderless and collapsed under its own weight on inactivity. The Guardian’s had been pummeled, few of their number remained. The Mysterium saw a change of leadership and an internal cleaning of house, its number was never certain, they remained detached from the Consilium following the rise of ''Siafu''. It was the Arrow that remained, hands still dripping with the blood of the Consilium’s enemies at the ready. it was ''Krieg'' and his warriors who held the line as ''Heron'' moved to solidify the Consilium during this turbulent time. The cost for that holding action has never been acknowledged thought rumors of soulstones, artifact, and debts has made it through more than one shrouded hallway.  %0a%3c %0a%3c !!!Consilium Hierarchy%0a%3c %0a%3c ||border=0 %0a%3c || [[Players.MageHierarchy#Hierarch|Hierarch]] ||%0a%3c || | ||%0a%3c || [[Players.MageHierarchy#OrderHeads|Heads of the Orders]] ||%0a%3c || | ||%0a%3c || [[Players.MageHierarchy#Councilor|councilors (Heads of the cabals)]] ||%0a%3c || | | | || %0a%3c || [[Players.MageHierarchy#Factotum|Factotums]] [[Players.MageHierarchy#Herald|Heralds]] [[Players.MageHierarchy#Sentinel|Sentinels]] || %0a%3c || | | | || %0a%3c || Mages in cabals ||%0a%3c || | ||%0a%3c || Unaligned Pentacle Mages (Solitaires) ||%0a%3c || Apostates and Sleepwalkers ||%0a%3c [[#ConsiliumEnd]]%0a%3c %0a%3c [[#LexMagica]]%0a%3c (:table border=0:)%0a%3c (:cellnr bgcolor=#004a80 align=center:)%0a%3c '''%25white%25The Lex Magica%25%25'''%0a%3c (:cellnr:)%0a%3c *[[#Lex-1|Preamble]]%0a%3c *[[#Lex-2|The Savannah Charter]]%0a%3c *[[#Lex-3|Rights of the Awakened]]%0a%3c *[[#Lex-4|Roles of the Awakened]]%0a%3c *[[#Lex-5|The Great Rights]]%0a%3c *[[#Lex-6|The Common Precepts]]%0a%3c *[[#Lex-7|The Right to Trial]]%0a%3c *[[#Lex-8|Punishments]]%0a%3c (:tableend:)%0a%3c [[%3c%3c]]%0a%3c [[%3c%3c]]%0a%3c %0a%3c !!The Lex Magica%0a%3c [[#Lex-1]]%0a%3c !!!Preamble%0a%3c %0a%3c We have arrived at the crossroads of the future, the past having paved our way to this present. Our steps are challenged by the Abyss, by enemies seen and unseen, by our own desires and our mortal flaws. We are Awakened, we persevere despite adversity; we are resilient, strong in mind and body, fortified with soul and will. Now we take the next step, we look to the future by founding a Consilium, a collection of like-minded Wise in the tradition of lost Atlantis.%0a%3c %0a%3c Now, as we establish ourselves, we follow in the traditions of those who came before us, paying respect to the methods and the works of our ancestors by path, by order and by blood. We establish that the city known as Savannah, and a protectorate of land around it, will be under the jurisdiction of the wise who reside here. Bordered by the Savannah River to our North and the Ogeechee River to the South, from the mighty Atlantic to our East to the area known as Skinner’s Bay to our West we now enact the Lex Magica of  the Consilium of Savannah Georgia, in this year 1742. Long may the watchtowers guide our steps.%0a%3c %0a%3c [--%25color=#365776%25[[#top| Back to top]]--]%0a%3c %0a%3c %0a%3c [[#Lex-2]]%0a%3c !!!The Savannah Charter%0a%3c %0a%3c Many roles are taken in the course of a mundane life, even more so upon Awakening. The titles we carry are our positions in society, both mundane and arcane. They are the badges of service that we wear, they denote the work we must perform for our society to flourish. The Consilium of Savannah will be conducted under the beneficial guidance of a Hierarch drawn from  any of the Diamond Orders (Changed to Pentacle Orders with the creation of the Free Council.) The Hierarch shall rise by merit, and not simple mastery, to lead the Wise in Savannah. The Hierarch will select a provost to aid them, to stand with them, and occasionally for them. Heralds and Sentinels will be drawn from the orders as needed, no order will have more than one of each, Herald or Sentinel, at one time. The Council of the Wise shall be comprised of the leaders of cabals within the city and the outlying protectorate of Savannah. Solitaires, will be protected, under the Lex and Apostasy will be discouraged without stigmata. Let all wise who follow the Lex exist under its Aegis. %0a%3c %0a%3c [--%25color=#365776%25[[#top| Back to top]]--]%0a%3c %0a%3c %0a%3c [[#Lex-3]]%0a%3c !!!Rights of the Awakened%0a%3c %0a%3c !!!!Obligations of the Wise to the Consilium of Savannah%0a%3c *All Awakened in the Savannah Consilium and its surrounding protectorate agree to the binding laws of the Lex Magica. The agreement to these honored laws will, in turn, protect the Wise from undue persecution, offering them representation and when accused, a voice when questioning and an Aegis from enemies of the Wise. Rejecting the Lex is rejecting its protection.%0a%3c %0a%3c *All Awakened agree to honor the Great Rights of other Awakened as proscribed by the Lex Magica.%0a%3c %0a%3c *All Awakened agree to keep the secrets of the Pentacle safe from its enemies, those named or those yet unnamed.%0a%3c %0a%3c *All Awakened will protect the Veil, the secrets of the wise will not be shared lightly. Our existence is not to be shared with others.%0a%3c %0a%3c *In times of war, in times of need, the Consilium can call upon the Awakened of Savannah to defend the city, the Consilium and and the wise from assault. This call to arms is a service to all the Awakened and should be considered a great honor to perform. Those who refuse to serve then refuse the Consilium’s protection during these troubled times.%0a%3c %0a%3c *The Awakened of Savannah may be called to testify, to provide witness for defense or prosecution of a trial. Cooperation is to be expected, all Awakened must acquit themselves to the best of their ability.  Refusal to do so is a disregarding of the responsibility of being among the Wise.%0a%3c %0a%3c *An Awakened may be required to provide a tithe of tass to the Consilium. This payment of tass could be for recognition and acceptance into the Consilium, for the establishment of territory as a solitaire or as a cabal, or could be required in the form of payment for a debt. Refusal to do so is a disregard of the responsibility of being among the Wise and standing within the Consilium could be affected by the unwillingness to contribute.%0a%3c %0a%3c %0a%3c !!!!Obligations of the Consilium to the Wise of Savannah%0a%3c %0a%3c *Representatives, Councilor or provost, of the established cabals of the Consilim shall meet monthly to discuss policy, ratify laws, make rulings in regards to the Lex Magica, mediate disputes between constituents, hear appeals, and levy punishments against offenders of the Lex.%0a%3c %0a%3c *During this time, the representative Councilors will recognize new Magi in the city, approve of new cabals and hear requests for territory within the city and the Protectorate. Also during this time, those who have served the Consilium will be recognized for their service.%0a%3c %0a%3c *The representatives of the cabals shall work with expediency. If a petitioning Wise has to wait more than a full season for an official response and ruling on their concern, the Council is expected to rule in the constituent’s favor.%0a%3c %0a%3c *The Consilium shall not move against an Awakened accused of a crime without a trial. The Council of cabals will provide the most neutral setting, with counsel for defense as well as counsel for the prosecution. There will be parity and equality, the innocence of the accused will exist, their wrongdoing must be proven.%0a%3c %0a%3c *The Consilium shall protect the Wise from unjust persecution. Any Wise in good standing may appeal to the Consilium at any time to appeal an invocation of the Great Right of Nemesis as being unjust and request intervention.%0a%3c %0a%3c *The Consilium shall protect its constituents from external threats. While the Consilium does not possess a standing army, it is expected to maintain healthy relations with the Pentacle Order heads and keep them appraised of all known threats, and if need be raise needed forces to repel attacks against the Consilium body.%0a%3c %0a%3c *The Consilium, like the individuals who are its body,  shall honor the Great Rights as laid out below in the Lex Magica.%0a%3c %0a%3c [--%25color=#365776%25[[#top| Back to top]]--]%0a%3c %0a%3c %0a%3c [[#Lex-4]]%0a%3c !!!Positions held by Player Characters%0a%3c !!!!Councilors%0a%3c (:toggle hide pcp-c button=1:)%0a%3c >>id=pcp-c border='1px solid #999' padding=5px bgcolor=#c5d8ee%3c%3c %0a%3c :Requirements:%0a%3c *The Councilor position is any head of a cabal that is recognized as being a member of the Consilium.%0a%3c *The cabal must have a minimum of three mages and be located in the city or the immediate area around the city.%0a%3c %0a%3c :Status:%0a%3c The Councilor will be give Consilium status 3 upon being recognized by the existing Council. %0a%3c *If a Councilor steps down in good standing they will get to keep 1 of the Consilium status dots for free. %0a%3c *If they are censured of forced out due to circumstances then they will lose all of these free dots.%0a%3c %0a%3c :Duties and Powers:Each Councilor has a single vote on all matters brought before the Consilium. This body will approve the amending of the Lex and are responsible for the day to day activities of the Consilium. This is the group that will approve territory, resolve minor disputes of territory, they will adjudicate public and personal offenses, decide on methods of protecting of sleepwalkers and so on. %0a%3c %0a%3c They are not order heads, they do not dictate order policy. %0a%3c %0a%3c Some of the powers of the Council are define as:%0a%3c %0a%3c 1) The passing of all amendments to the Lex that are crafted by the Factotums with a majority vote.%0a%3c %0a%3c 2) In the event that a Sentinel position becomes vacant due to loss, retirement or censure, the Council will vote in the next Sentinel to that position. The position is order specific, they cannot vote in 2 of any one order, instead each order must be represented. %0a%3c %0a%3c 3) If a Sentinel or Herald is censured then the Council appoints the appropriate time that the position must remain vacant. Time will be no greater than three months unless the crime is unspeakably heinous.%0a%3c %0a%3c 4) The Council has the right to call a vote of no confidence against an order head. If this happens the Council can remove an order head from their position due to abuse of power or a blatant breaking of the Lex Magica. This is a dangerous precedent and can only be accomplished with a unanimous Council vote.%0a%3c %0a%3c 5) The Council can censure other Council members though this does not remove them from their position has the head of their cabal. It does however strip them of Councilor status. If this happens then the Council can then also reduce the territory claimed by said cabal within reason. This has to happen with a majority vote. Examples of the reasons a vote may be called include willfully ignoring Council orders, breaking the Lex Magica, ignoring the positions of Herald, Sentinel or Order Head, or can be called due to inactivity within the Council itself. %0a%3c %0a%3c 6) The Council must recognize the Right of Nemesis before hostilities begin.%0a%3c %0a%3c :Expectations:%0a%3c Each time a cabal is formed they then come before the Council to be recognized. It is standard practice to accept the new cabal without question, to afford the new Councilor their position and badge to stand alongside their fellow councilors. It is a serious breach of etiquette to try and deny a new Councilor their status. %0a%3c  %0a%3c :Restrictions:A Councilor cannot hold a second office outside of Councilor. There are no combo Councilor/heralds or sentinels. %0a%3c %0a%3c :ST Note:This is a player driven game and the position of Councilor will allow those who are looking for their political game to get their trench warfare on. No character should be hamstrung waiting on an order head because the body of councilors will be doing a majority of the work. Unlike the core which suggests that the orders and the paths be the ruling Council it is more manageable and active to use councilors made of cabal heads. These are the groups that dictate the day to day policies and actions of the Consilium. It requires people who wish to be cabal heads to understand there is some work to be done. All of you have been in games where there is a cabal that is a paper tiger, only coming on to deal in politics and sometimes making a mess of things. This system will help combat that lethargy. You have to be active, your cabal has to be active for you to keep a vote. A majority vote keeps the process simple, the ability to remove other councilors and even an order head is a HUGE issue and should not be treated lightly. It’s difficult, but it can be done. It also allows for a realistic Consilium where not every mage and their brother need attend a meeting. This way you don’t have to scroll through 4 pages of chatter to get to the first question.%0a%3c %0a%3c I want you, the players, to define your Consilium, to define how the Lex is interpreted and applied in game. I want you to be the ones who fight for rules, laws, and mandates that are created by one another. This is another step in the process to offer you another tier in which to operate, to have allies and enemies. You will be encouraged to push order business through by way of the Herald, you will deal with one another and the masses by way of the Sentinel, you will police each other with your position as Councilor. %0a%3c >>%3c%3c%0a%3c %0a%3c !!!!Factotum%0a%3c (:toggle hide pcp-f button=1:)%0a%3c >>id=pcp-f border='1px solid #999' padding=5px bgcolor=#c5d8ee%3c%3c %0a%3c %0a%3c :Requirements:%0a%3c *Academics 3 (Specialty: Lex Magica)%0a%3c *Investigation 1%0a%3c *Occult 2%0a%3c *Politics 2%0a%3c *Persuasion 2%0a%3c *Mentor 1 (To represent the NPC who will teach the Lex and its interpretations and how to proceed with a case in front of the Consilium)%0a%3c *Patron: a member in their order or another other of at least one status higher than their current status.%0a%3c *Suggested but not required: Mind and Prime arcana%0a%3c Note: The Factotum is traditionally a Silver Ladder position, though it is not unheard of for other Orders to have a member who has passed the Silver Ladder tests.%0a%3c %0a%3c :Status:%0a%3c Silver Ladder characters will automatically gain status 2 as a Factotum, though they may not earn the other title associated with status 2 until later. They will be able to keep their mentor merit if they wish, or they can change the merit to Ally or Contact within the Silver Ladder.%0a%3c %0a%3c There is no automatic bump in status for non-Silver Ladder  characters who become Factotums. Upon graduation the mentor merit must be changed into either allies or contacts with the Silver Ladder at 1 dot.%0a%3c %0a%3c :Duties and Powers:%0a%3c For those with the Silver Ladder supplement, you might remember reading about the position of Factotum on page 77.. More than just a lawyer, the Factotum is a specialist who studies, argues, defends and creates amendments to the Lex Magica. There is no one universal Lex, instead each Consili has their own version, though many are similar in a multitude of ways. %0a%3c %0a%3c Factotums will be the only characters who will be able to deliberate and prosecute the Lex should an event come up that there needs to be a “trial” or a ruling on the Lex. Factotums will also have the ability to pen amendments to the Lex, essentially they will be counsel for those who wish to seek change. %0a%3c %0a%3c ‘’An example would be that the Free Council has decided a part of the Lex is outdated and they want to see a change. They would go to a Factotum, explain what their idea is, and the Factotum will pen an amendment. Once the amendment meets the needs of the Free Council, the Factotum can put it in front of the councilors and the Heads of the Orders for a vote to see if the amendment will be adopted. They will be able to speak to the Council and the Order heads in the defense of the Amendment.’’%0a%3c %0a%3c In this, the Factotum is not only the “lawyer” of the Consilium, but they are the representatives that propose change to the law. If an Order does not have a Factotum of their own, then they must seek one out from another order, and there could be some form of payment demanded for services. %0a%3c %0a%3c :Expectations:%0a%3c The process for any character wishing to become a Factotum is the same no matter what order they originate from. The character must secure a Patron. (This can be done with role-play, with an agreement of a debt or a favor, or it could be politically motivated by plot.) Once the character has a patron they then petition the Silver Ladder to be taken on as a student of the Lex.  Once this happens, the ST and the Player will set up an arrangement on how this will progress. %0a%3c %0a%3c Becoming a Factotum takes more than a month, but how much time it takes is up to the player and their investment. There are ways to condense time studying and an enterprising player will figure them out.%0a%3c %0a%3c When the time is ready for the Factotum test(s) it will be a scene run by the storyteller. If the test(s) is/ are not passed the player can choose to take them again in the future (some time will need to pass before that happens) or they can leave the study of the Lex.%0a%3c %0a%3c :ST Note:%0a%3c The political game will happen. As with all WoD splats, politics is part and parcel of the game. Personally, I like always keeping a knife under the robes when hanging out with senators, keeps you on your toes. The political game will exist for people who want it, but, remember that line from Constantine when Rachel Weisz says “I don’t believe in the Devil,” and Keanu ‘Whoa!’ Reeves responds with “Why not? He believes in you.” That is how politics will work, you may not want to play the political game, but you sure as hell can feel its effects. If someone does something politically that you do not like you cannot “opt out” of the effects, and what is more, spending willpower will not change the outcome for you. This said, you don’t have to play politics, make friends who like to play politics and develop a buffer.%0a%3c >>%3c%3c%0a%3c %0a%3c !!!!Herald%0a%3c (:toggle hide pcp-h button=1:)%0a%3c >>id=pcp-h border='1px solid #999' padding=5px bgcolor=#c5d8ee%3c%3c %0a%3c %0a%3c :Requirements:%0a%3c * Position appointed by Order head%0a%3c * No Herald can hold another position within the Consilium while performing the Herald duties. %0a%3c %0a%3c :Status:%0a%3c Heralds are given Consilium Status 2 for free, the status is tied to the position, should the Herald leave the position in good standing they will keep one dot as a reward. Should they be censured or leave under circumstance then they will lose these free dots.%0a%3c %0a%3c :Duties and Powers:%0a%3c This position is getting expanded but also defined in its role and its obligation. The Herald position will be the direct voice from the heads of each order to the Consilium, to the councilors of the cabals as well as the unaligned mages within the city. The Heralds operate with the seal and the approval of the order leaders, their word is the words of those on high. Characters will ignore this position at their own risk. %0a%3c %0a%3c Heralds will be able to enter cabal territory without announcement when on Consilium business. Furthermore they will be afforded the rite of hospitality due to their office. This gives them the right to impose for sanctuary. %0a%3c %0a%3c The Rite of Censure: Heralds will be able to censure councilors of the Consilium (by councilors I mean the heads of cabals,) sentinels, individual mages and potentially the heads of the various orders. This rite of censure is the political ability to “cap” another character’s status. %0a%3c %0a%3c :Expectations:%0a%3c Abuse of powers and duties will be dealt with harshly In Character: These abilities do not give the Herald cart blanche to be rude or demanding. In the case of the Rite of Censure, serious justification will be required. Such abuse could lead to the Herald being censured.%0a%3c %0a%3c If a Herald is censured, this is a blow to their respective order. Not only will the Herald in question be stripped of their title and their status but the order will lose the position for a number of months agreed upon by the councilors. While the Herald can censure councilors for abusing their power, so can the Herald be removed by the councilors for abuse of their power. During the time a Herald is censured the order has no voice of its own and must operate through other the Heralds from other orders. Needless to say, order agenda may get dicey at this point.%0a%3c %0a%3c :ST Note:%0a%3c A natural question will be, “what is stopping the order heads from operating directly with the councilors?” The answer is this, détente. Sure, an order head can speak with a Councilor of their own order without much though, but to speak with councilors of other orders, well, they need to be polite. The order heads are status 4 and 5 individuals but they are not above the Lex or the Consilium. The Herald acts as a conduit to and from lower status mages, and unaligned mages, because order heads do not always answer the messages left by status one or zero mages. %0a%3c %0a%3c The practical application of the Herald position gives a clear and concise chain of communication. You want business with an order head you go through a Herald or you have the Herald arrange a meeting. This should remove the wait for NPC’s for action. It drives the IC aspect of the political game. It removes some of potential ST Fiat and gives you more avenues to explore Role-play. %0a%3c >>%3c%3c%0a%3c %0a%3c !!!!Sentinel%0a%3c (:toggle hide pcp-s button=1:)%0a%3c >>id=pcp-s border='1px solid #999' padding=5px bgcolor=#c5d8ee%3c%3c %0a%3c %0a%3c :Requirements:%0a%3c *None, sentinels are voted into positions by councilors of the Consilium%0a%3c %0a%3c :Status:%0a%3c %0a%3c :Duties and Powers:%0a%3c Unlike the traditional concept of the “enforcer” of the Consilium, here the Sentinel is charged with keeping peace ‘’between’’ the cabals as well as serving as something more akin to a palace guard:%0a%3c *Make Consilium aware of threats and respond to those threats.%0a%3c *With Consilium approval, they may take a mage into custody for breaking the Lex or a Consilium mandate. %0a%3c *Bodyguards of order heads in official Consilium meetings and functions.%0a%3c *Sentinels may enter cabal territory with formal, prior announcement (calling beforehand) of their intention and reason for entering. They do not need the permission of the cabal when on Consilium business. They are expected to be afforded the Rite of Hospitality without question.%0a%3c *Witness to Duel Arcane:  To be recognized by the Council and the Orders as a valid and binding challenge, at least one Sentinel who is not a member of either combatant’s order, or cabal, must be a physical witness to the duel. It is the responsibility of the duelists to agree to a Sentinel and approach the Sentinel to witness the duel. The Sentinel is under no obligation to do so, thus preventing the duel if necessary.%0a%3c *May call a vote of no confidence on a Councilor. The sentinels will need to have a majority vote to enact this vote, and will have to develop and deliver this vote to the Consilium as a whole.%0a%3c %0a%3c :Expectations:%0a%3c There is no such thing a Sentinel’s “Citizen’s Arrest.” The Sentinel must be charged with a task by the Order heads or councilors of the Consilium. However, when detention is sanctioned by the Consilium, a mage is expected to submit to the Sentinel. This is not considered an admission of guilt.%0a%3c Abuse of power or duties will not be tolerated. Like a Herald, if a Sentinel is censured, it is a blow to the order. The Sentinel will be stripped of their title, their status and the order will lose the position for a number of months agreed upon by the councilors. They can be removed by the councilors for abuse of their power. During this time the order has no guard of its own and must operate through other sentinels and orders. %0a%3c  %0a%3c :Restrictions: No Sentinel can also be a Councilor or hold another position within the Consilium while performing the Sentinel duties.  Furthermore, a Sentinel should not be a Banner Warden for a cabal because their duty in Consilium functions will be to the Order Head of their order.%0a%3c :ST Note:%0a%3c %0a%3c ST Note: The Sentinel is not exactly a policeman, nor exactly a politician, but they sometimes fill these roles. The Sentinels look to make sure that violations of the Lex are met responsibly and with organization. Where the Guardians of the Veil protect the mortals from the Awakened, and the Arrow protects the Consilium and the mortals from external threats, the sentinels make sure that the Lex is followed and that mages are held responsible for their actions. Again, these positions are in place to remove the wait for NPC action on an event.%0a%3c >>%3c%3c%0a%3c %0a%3c [--%25color=#365776%25[[#top| Back to top]]--]%0a%3c %0a%3c %0a%3c [[#Lex-5]]%0a%3c !!!The Great Rights%0a%3c %0a%3c The Consilium recognizes the Great Rights, not only as Rights to be claimed by individual cabals, but as basic rights of all recognized constituent magi and the foundation for the Lex Magica. Any cabal or magi applying for territory is expected to inform the Consilium as to which of these rights they will honor in their territory; failure to do so is grounds for denial of the cabal or magi’s petition for territory. Any right a cabal or individual magi does not extend to others may be freely denied to them by other constituents (if cabal A doesn't honor the Right of Hospitality, cabal B is under no obligation to honor that Right for cabal A if they ask, even if cabal B usually does honor the Right of Hospitality).%0a%3c %0a%3c :The Right of Crossing: Let no borders stop an Awakened with a clear heart.%0a%3c Magi traveling through the territory of another may pass unmolested, provided the traveler refrains from practicing offensive magic in the territory he is passing through. The traveling time is expected to be succinct. Magi following this Right are not expected to guard their entire territory; instead, they are urged to mark 'Safe Paths' through their territory in coordination with the Cartographer. Magi found straying from the Safe Path shall be given a chance to get back on, given the benefit of the doubt that they might be lost. A magi found to be continually straying or found performing hostile magic may expect to be forcibly ejected from the territory and may be subject to a grievance brought before the Consilium by the offended cabal.%0a%3c %0a%3c :The Right of Emeritus: Those who have earned respect must be treated with respect.%0a%3c Individuals are free to interpret this Right as it suits them within their cabals. When applied towards interactions with the rest of the constituents of the Consilium and the Consilium’s officers, lack of respect given will almost always translate into lack of respect received, and repeated violators of this Right may find their actions a matter of public record. With a simple majority vote the Council may rule that a constituent who has repeatedly been reported for violating the Right of Emeritus may be publicly marked as an exception to the Right of Hospitality for a length of time, usually no longer than three months. No magi would suffer any consequences for denying it to the offender during that length of time.%0a%3c %0a%3c :The Right of Hospitality: Those who request hospitality must be granted it.%0a%3c When this Right is invoked by a visitor, a host must provide food and security to the visitor so that she may rest and recuperate. The Right protects a mage for a visit of a week in length. During this time, she is expected to be protected from threats both internal and external, given a roof over her head, and fed at least the bare minimum to keep a human adult alive. Serious, life-threatening wounds are to be treated to the extent that the mage's health is stabilized.%0a%3c %0a%3c :The Right of Nemesis: When vengeance is declared, let none stand in his way.%0a%3c When constituent magi clash, no others should interfere unless the feud becomes a direct threat to them, their territories, their sanctums, or Sleepers under their care. The Right of Nemesis must be formally declared to the Warden and Historian in order to be honored by the Consilium. The Council may intercede at their discretion if the conflict grows out of control or if one or both parties appeals to them for arbitration.%0a%3c %0a%3c :The Right of Sanctuary: Protect your home, and let no action cause it harm.%0a%3c Constituents are free to set parameters of behavior for residents and guests within their territories. Violations of these parameters may result in the host revoking the Right of Hospitality. Outright attacks on a constituent's sanctum or hallow may be responded to in kind, and in fact is valid grounds for invoking the Right of Nemesis.%0a%3c %0a%3c [--%25color=#365776%25[[#top| Back to top]]--]%0a%3c %0a%3c %0a%3c [[#Lex-6]]%0a%3c !!!The Common Precepts%0a%3c %0a%3c Beyond the Great Rights, the Consilium holds the following to be law, and all constituents bound by it regardless of path or order.%0a%3c %0a%3c !!!!Precept of Secrecy%0a%3c Due to the dangers of vulgar magic and disbelief, the existence of magic must be kept secret from those who do not practice it. Divulging these secrets can potentially compromise the security of the rest of the Consilium and Pentacle society at large. Therefore;%0a%3c %0a%3c No constituent may cast vulgar magic before Sleeper witnesses. Any magi found guilty of violating this law shall be given a Major Reprimand at minimum, subject to stricter punishment with repeat offenses, or if the Sleeper witness manages to pass along what they have seen to others, at which point a Major Penance is recommended.%0a%3c %0a%3c No constituent may leave evidence of magic having been performed, or leave magic or a miracle as one of the only explanations for a given scenario. For example, if a magi is imprisoned by Sleeper authorities and simply decides to teleport out of their cell in the middle of the night, that magi might be in violation of this law guards were posted in the hallway the entire evening. The recommended punishment for this violation is a Minor Penance.%0a%3c %0a%3c No constituent may speak of the Mysteries before Sleepers. Doing so has potentially contributed to the creation of witch-hunters and Banishers in the past, and potentially endangers other magi. The recommended punishment for this violation is Imprisonment of a length determined by the High Council.%0a%3c %0a%3c No constituent may attempt to teach Sleepers the Mysteries. Efforts in this field have proven futile over thousands of years, and it is foolhardy to try. At best, the magi risks the Sleeper's sanity. At worst, the magi risks the lives of other magi. The recommended punishment for this violation is Banishment of a length determined by the High Council.%0a%3c %0a%3c No Constituent may betray Arcane knowledge to other non-Pentacle supernatural societies. Banishers wish only to annihilate magic and its practitioners. Seers wish only to enslave Sleepers and keep the Mysteries for themselves and their Exarch masters. Other secret societies of magi and stranger things might have other agendas as sinister as the Seers. The recommended punishment for this violation is Banishment of a length determined by the High Council.%0a%3c %0a%3c !!!!Precept of Recognition%0a%3c The Consilium shall record all formal punishments, as well as the actions and circumstances leading to those punishments. These records shall be used as precedent for all future prosecutions of similar crimes. A crime that is recognized might not be punished, but the transgression must still be recorded.%0a%3c %0a%3c All magi who reside within the Consilium’s claimed borders must abide by the Consilium’s laws.  A magi or cabal who wishes to be recognized as willing to abide by its laws and support the Consilium must present themselves in person to the Council. They shall be asked for a simple declaration of their shadow name, the Path he has walked, a brief description of the journey, and the name of his Order. cabals shall be asked to make these introductions in addition to outlining requested territory. Each Councilor is then permitted to ask one question of the magi. If pressed for time, the Councilors may elect to ask their question of an entire cabal as a collective unit rather than each individual magi. After the formalities are complete, the Council shall vote; a simple majority is all that is required to recognize a magi or a cabal.%0a%3c %0a%3c A magi's sanctum, if recognized by the Council, is generally no longer secret, but its standards at the time of its recognition are accepted as legal.%0a%3c %0a%3c !!!!Precept of Protectorate%0a%3c Any recognized territory or sanctum falls under the auspices of the Precept of Protectorate. Constituent magi are not required to divulge the locations of their sanctums. However, hiding such knowledge from the Ruling Council is a rejection of the Council's help with future catastrophes when the constituent's sanctum would normally require assistance.%0a%3c %0a%3c A magi who shares such information may expect a certain degree of protection. During times of emergency, the Ruling Council may offer to help magically fortify constituent sanctums (with the permission of the resident magi).%0a%3c %0a%3c The Council does not expect a petitioner to approach them for redress every time a trespasser from another Order walks through their neighborhood, nor should a mage take offense every time a mage approaches his door and merely knocks without sending a proper introduction. However, repeated or more grievous violations should be brought before the Consilium.%0a%3c %0a%3c No constituent may enter the territory or approach the sanctum of another constituent unannounced and without stating their destination and intention. A simple phone call will do. While traversing a constituent's territory via a Safe Path is perfectly acceptable and does not require announcement, any straying from this path requires announcement. The resident constituent may deny the request for any reason. The only exceptions occur with Heralds and Sentinels (see Heralds and Sentinels in the Charter for their powers and limitations in regards to this right). The recommended punishment for this transgression is a Minor Reprimand.%0a%3c %0a%3c No constituent may, intentionally or not, cause a Sleeper investigation within sight of another mage's sanctum. The potential exists for the mage's sanctum to fall under Sleeper scrutiny, which might create an unacceptable breach of the precept of secrecy. The recommended punishment for this transgression is a Major Reprimand.%0a%3c %0a%3c No constituent may test the wards or limits of another mage's sanctum. Such behavior almost invariably leads to retaliation, which weakens the fiber and focus of the Protectorate. The recommended punishment for this transgression is a Minor Penance.%0a%3c %0a%3c No constituent may enter the sanctum of another mage without permission. A mage's sanctum is a home and an assured place of privacy. Mages who violate this precept by intruding into another mage's sanctum can expect to have their capability to intrude to be taken from them. The recommended punishment for this transgression is Incarceration of a length of time determined by the Ruling Council, but not to exceed one month except in the case of repeated violations.%0a%3c %0a%3c No constituent may initiate a magical attack against another mage's sanctum. If the wronged mage brings it before the Ruling Council for trial, the Ruling Council may levy a punishment as if the mage had intruded upon the sanctum, as well as requiring a Payment of Debt from the guilty party to the petitioner. Alternatively, the wronged mage is within their rights to declare Nemesis, and the Ruling Council may repeal the Precept of Protectorate in regards to the offending magi's own sanctum.%0a%3c %0a%3c !!!!Precept of Hubris%0a%3c Legislating morality has historically been shaky ground. When dealing with beings capable of altering reality on a whim, however, we must bind ourselves to commonly agreed upon codes of behavior and agree upon actions that tarnish and dishonor the great power and responsibility we have been given. Therefore;%0a%3c %0a%3c No constituent shall perform the following against another constituent magi; casting a curse, forcing an unwilling transformation, binding another's soul, magical attacks (unless performed within a sanctioned Duel Arcane), or aiding in spiritual possession. Magi will always disagree on some point or another, and in some cases disagreements can become heated to the point of violence. Using magic as a tool for assault is worthy of censure, as it is irresponsible and does not further the goals of the Pentacle. The recommended punishment for these transgressions is a Minor Reprimand, with punishments for repeated violations subject to the offender’s history and the High Council's discretion.%0a%3c %0a%3c No constituent shall perform the following against a sleepwalker or sleeper; casting a curse, forcing an unwilling transformation, binding another's soul, magical attacks, or aiding in spiritual possession. Such actions threaten the Precept of Secrecy and should be swiftly stopped. The wounds and scars that result often act as evidence that sorcery is real. Furthermore, sleepers and sleepwalkers, unlike magi, are incapable of defending themselves from most of these assaults. Such tyranny should be left to the servants of the Lie while the Pentacle holds itself to a higher standard. The recommended punishment for these transgressions is a Severe Reprimand, with punishments for repeated violations subject to the offender’s history and the High Council's discretion.%0a%3c %0a%3c No constituent shall perform the following against another constituent magi; exiling to the Shadow Realm, murder (magical or otherwise), or soul theft. These actions weaken the Protectorate and should not be tolerated. The recommended punishment for these transgressions will be fitting of the crime, with punishments of increasing severity appearing for repeated violations subject to the offender’s history and the High Council's discretion.%0a%3c %0a%3c No constituent shall perform the following against sleepwalkers or sleepers; exiling to the Shadow Realm, murder (magical or otherwise), or soul theft. If lesser assault against a sleeper is worse than a lesser assault against a magi, then it logically follows that these greater assaults carry a heavier punishment when inflicted upon sleepwalkers and sleepers. The recommended punishment for these transgressions is Incarceration, with punishments for repeated violations subject to the offender’s history and the High Council's discretion.%0a%3c %0a%3c No constituent shall attempt to force a sleeper or sleepwalker to awaken. In the thousands of years our predecessors were practicing magic, no means of deliberately making contact with a supernal watchtower, even on anothers behalf, has been discovered. If that were the case, the Seers would be a thing of the past. Given the unusually high number of Sleepwalkers in Providence and the fact that some of them have painful or violent reactions to proximate magic, doing things such as repeatedly casting magic around them with the intent to force them to awaken shall be looked upon as magical assault. At best, it will only create an awakened mage that distrusts or even hates the Pentacle. At worst, it will create a dead sleepwalker or a Banisher. The recommended punishment for this transgression is a Severe Reprimand, with punishments for repeated violations subject to the offender’s history and the High Council's discretion.%0a%3c %0a%3c !!!!Precept of War%0a%3c One of the Consilium’s functions is to peacefully resolve conflicts between constituent magi. When the system works, both parties agree with the outcome of the trial. When the system doesn't work, one party may be so discontent with the decision that they decide to take matters into their own hands.%0a%3c %0a%3c A petitioner or a representative of the petitioning cabal must appear before the Council, petitioning them to accept her or her cabal's temporary withdrawal from their system of law. The mage must testify to the actions that the other party has taken against her or her cabal. With a 2/3 majority vote, the Council can decide to formally proceed by invoking the Precept of War. If the Council does not, then the petitioner shall be informed that no matter what she claims, the Council will treat her like any other magi in the city, passing judgment on her actions if anyone files a complaint.%0a%3c %0a%3c If the Precept of War is invoked, the petitioner shall announce the limits of their aggression. Alternatively, the Council may with a simple majority vote set limits on the level of aggression or dispatch Sentinels to break up the fight if it spins out of control.%0a%3c %0a%3c Even under conditions of war, combatants will still be held to the Precepts of Secrecy.%0a%3c %0a%3c Limits of aggression, or rules of engagement, are as follows:%0a%3c %0a%3c :Street Warfare: The cabal announces that it will attack but not violate the sanctity of its rivals’ sanctum.%0a%3c %0a%3c :Spiritual Warfare: The cabal announces that they intend to use open magic in the Shadow Realm, an invitation to “take the fight outside,” so Sleepers needn’t witness it.%0a%3c %0a%3c :Sanctum Warfare: The cabal confides in the Consilium that it intends to strike back at its rivals’ sanctum. The cabal-members do not expect any redress or compensation for the retaliation that must inevitably follow.%0a%3c %0a%3c :Shadow Warfare: The cabal chooses to confide that they are striking against another supernatural society. They acknowledge that they alone are responsible, and they must personally bear responsibility for the backlash that follows.%0a%3c %0a%3c :The Duel Arcane: The cabal wants to send a champion against their rivals’ champion to conduct single combat, so that greater bloodshed can be prevented.%0a%3c %0a%3c [--%25color=#365776%25[[#top| Back to top]]--]%0a%3c %0a%3c %0a%3c [[#Lex-7]]%0a%3c !!!Right to Trial%0a%3c %0a%3c Any recognized magi can bring an accusation of breaking the Lex against another magi. All recognized magi are entitled to a trial. If a Sleeper has been victimized by a mage's actions, any recognized mage who witnessed the crime or has evidence of it may file a grievance against the offender. If a mage has been victimized (and survived), the Consilium requires the victim to appear before the Council to state their grievance. In the event that the victim is deceased or otherwise incapable of giving testimony, the Council may instead hear grievance from a representative of the victim's cabal or order.%0a%3c %0a%3c After the initial hearing, the Council must decide whether they must rely on precedents set in the Lex Magica to resolve the issue. In the event there is cause for a trial, or a punishment of any kind, the accused has the right to be defended by a Factotum.  Minor transgressions may only warrant a warning or a formal announcement, but relying upon the Lex also means that the transgression must be logged and recorded according to the Precept of Recognition and then becomes part of the precedents of the Lex. Any further transgressions committed by a guilty mage must be evaluated in light of this transgression.%0a%3c %0a%3c The hearing shall begin with a dialogue between the Councilors, among the points discussed being whether or not this crime has been punished under the Lex before. A truly unique crime could lead to a trial if the Protectorate has never seen its like, in which case the opening dialogue shall acknowledge that the trial may be proceeding without precedent in order to give everyone involved extra time to search for any precedent or illumination that may affect the outcome of the trial. A simple majority vote of the Ruling Council is all that is needed to begin a trial under the auspices of the Lex.%0a%3c %0a%3c The Council must then wait at least 24 hours before beginning the trial, but may wait no longer than a month. This gives the Council flexibility to schedule multiple trials over the course of a day if they need to.%0a%3c %0a%3c The Council must consider the nature of the trial. In cases involving the city's Sentinels or Guardians of the Veil, evidence might need to be kept secret. A 2/3 majority vote is required to keep the proceedings of the trial secret.%0a%3c %0a%3c The mage who brought the case to trial – the Petitioner – may choose a Factotum to represent him, usually called an Advocate. The Advocate doesn't serve as a lawyer, but if he accepts, he has several responsibilities to the Petitioner. First, witnesses: if the petitioner requires witnesses, the Advocate decides the means by which they are brought before the Council. A simple request should do. Failure to appear before the Consilium may be taken as a rejection of the Consilium, along with its justice and protection. In cases involving serious crimes (anything worthy of a punishment beyond a major penance), Sentinels may be tasked with bringing in witnesses against their will.%0a%3c %0a%3c The Advocate must then approach the accused and summon them before Consilium. The trial may proceed anyway without the cooperation of the accused. The Accused and/or the Petitioner may appoint a Factotum from their order to speak on their behalf. If the Accused or Petitioner has no suitable Factotum in their order, then they may negotiate with other Pentacle Orders for the use of their Factotum, provided no conflict of interest is created.%0a%3c %0a%3c The trial, at the discretion of the Council, can require the Petitioner, Accused, and any Factotums to attend. It also might involve some or none of them, depending on whether the proceedings are secret. Regardless, the trial must be held in a venue neutral to both the Petitioner and the Accused, and it is the Council's duty to find such a place.%0a%3c %0a%3c Once the mages are assembled, the trial shall open with a brief ritual invoking the Lex. The High Council shall act as the jury while the Hierarch acts as the judge. The trial shall be conducted in a manner similar to that of a U.S. Court. The Petitioner and the Accused (or their Factotums) will begin by stating their cases, and then they shall call their witnesses. The opposing side may cross-examine witnesses. Any Councilor is free to use magic to aid in discerning the truth.%0a%3c %0a%3c Once both the Accused and Petitioner have rested their cases, each Councilor may then have the podium to express their opinion and cite precedents and luminaries that should influence the decision. Once each Councilor has had a chance to state their opinion, all of the High Councilors retire to decide the verdict. A simple majority is required to decide to punish the accused.%0a%3c %0a%3c The High Council will then return and face the Accused and Petitioner, if present. They will render verdict. At this time, any Councilors may take the podium and suggest suitable punishment. After all Councilors have had their say the Hierarch will pass sentence, as well as determine who will be responsible for enforcing the sentence.%0a%3c %0a%3c [--%25color=#365776%25[[#top| Back to top]]--]%0a%3c %0a%3c %0a%3c [[#Lex-8]]%0a%3c !!!Punishments: The 10 Letters of the Tetragrammaton%0a%3c %0a%3c The degrees of punishment listed below are known among western magi as the 10 Letters of the Tetragrammaton. They are listed here in order of degree of severity.%0a%3c %0a%3c Every punishment levied shall have a specified duration, known as a stigma. By tradition, a stigma usually corresponds to a natural or mystical phenomena: from dusk till dawn, the phase of the moon or a lunar cycle, and so on. More precise terms for stigmas, such as calendar days, weeks, or months, are also acceptable.%0a%3c %0a%3c :Minor Reprimand:%0a%3c The Council, through the Historian and the Heralds, issues a formal statement that it frowns upon the actions of the offender. While no further action may be taken at this time, the incident is recorded and archived by the Historian, and may be used as cause for more severe punishment in the event of further or repeat transgressions.%0a%3c %0a%3c :Major Reprimand:%0a%3c The Council requests that all officers of the Orders and the Consilium limit their assistance to the offender. In some cases, the Councilors may even warn other cabals or mages against helping the criminal.%0a%3c %0a%3c :Payment of Debt:%0a%3c The offender must pay a debt, usually in the form of a favor, act or deed, to the wronged party. Alternatively, the offender might take up a debt that the wronged party owes to another. The nature of the repayment as well as the timetable for executing repayment is determined by the High Council.%0a%3c %0a%3c :Minor Penance:%0a%3c The offender must atone for her act by performing a service for the Consilium. The nature of the task is left up to the High Council and should not be a dangerous task; merely laborous.%0a%3c %0a%3c :Major Penance:%0a%3c The offender must perform a risky or dangerous act for the benefit of the Consilium. The High Council determines the nature of the task and the timetable for completion.%0a%3c %0a%3c :Severe Reprimand:%0a%3c The Consilium states bluntly that no one (not even initiates) may aid or assist the offending mage, clarifying the duration of the reprimand. Offering assistance merits the same punishment, “tarring” the collaborator “with the same brush.” The mage is then either instructed to meditate in seclusion or abstain from practicing magic. Failure to comply leads to incarceration.%0a%3c %0a%3c :Incarceration:%0a%3c The offender is magically confined, surrounded by powerful wards that cripple his magical power and guarded by the Warden and his Sentinels. The offender must meditate on his actions. The High Council determines the length of the incarceration and whether or not the incarcerated shall be allowed visitors.%0a%3c %0a%3c :Banishment:%0a%3c This may sometimes be used as an alternative to incarceration. The offender is given orders to leave the city, sometimes for a specific period of time. If she returns during that time, she faces incarceration or worse. The stigma can include further details of where the mage must go or what she must do before she returns, as dictated by the High Council.%0a%3c %0a%3c :Spiritual Scourging (Confinement or Banishment):This punishment has only been performed ten times since the founding of the current Consilium in the early 1950s. A master of Death can steal an Awakened soul. When carrying out a sentence of spiritual confinement, the master of Death binds a mage’s soul in a protected place for the duration of a stigma before restoring it to its owner. When performing a rite of spiritual banishment, the master sends the soul far away. This may involve hurling it into the Shadow Realm or instructing the Warden or Executor to carry it to another city. Spiritual banishment often results in a quest, as the mage must either chase down the soul herself or find allies who can do so for her.%0a%3c %0a%3c :Spiritual Oblivion:This punishment has only been performed once before in the Consilium’s history; the Hierarch responsible for passing sentence immediately resigned once the business as concluded, along with the Guardian High Councilor and the Executor. The offender’s very soul is destroyed, rendering him incapable of performing magic. Sentencing a mage in this fashion — and actually performing the spiritual execution — is still a punishable offense under the Lex.%0a%3c %0a%3c [--%25color=#365776%25[[#top| Back to top]]--]%0a%3c %0a%3c (:table cellpadding=5:)%0a%3c (:cell bgcolor=#004a80 width=175 align=center:)%25white%25Acknowledgement:%0a%3c (:cell:)A significant amount of this Lex Magica was unrepentantly cribbed from the Lex Magic/Council Charter of Providence with the knowledge and permission of author Nosferajew (2009).%0a%3c (:tableend:)%0a%3c [[#LexMagicaEnd]]%0a%3c %0a%3c [[#Mage Orders]]%0a%3c [[#Mage OrdersEnd]]%0a%3c %0a%3c [[#Sleepwalkers]]%0a%3c [[#SleepwalkersEnd]]%0a%3c %0a%3c [[#Apostates]]%0a%3c [[#ApostatesEnd]]%0a%3c [[#Antagonists]]%0a%3c [[#AntagonistsEnd]]%0a%3c %0a%3c ----%0a%3c !!The Venue Content%0a%3c %0a%3c [[#HouseRules]]%0a%3c (:table border=0:)%0a%3c (:cellnr bgcolor=#004a80 align=center:)%0a%3c '''%25white%25Mage House Rules%25%25'''%0a%3c (:cellnr:)%0a%3c *...%0a%3c (:tableend:)%0a%3c [[%3c%3c]]%0a%3c [[#HouseRulesEnd]]%0a%3c %0a%3c [[#CharacterCreation]]%0a%3c (:table border=0:)%0a%3c (:cellnr bgcolor=#004a80 align=center:)%0a%3c '''%25white%25Mage Character Creation%25%25'''%0a%3c (:cellnr:)%0a%3c *...%0a%3c (:tableend:)%0a%3c [[%3c%3c]]%0a%3c [[#CharacterCreationEnd]]%0a%3c %0a%3c [[#CharacterGuidelines]]%0a%3c (:table border=0:)%0a%3c (:cellnr bgcolor=#004a80 align=center:)%0a%3c '''%25white%25Mage Character Guidelines%25%25'''%0a%3c (:cellnr:)%0a%3c *...%0a%3c (:tableend:)%0a%3c [[%3c%3c]]%0a%3c [[#CharacterGuidelinesEnd]]%0a%3c %0a%3c [[#BookPolicy]]%0a%3c (:table border=0:)%0a%3c (:cellnr bgcolor=#004a80 align=center:)%0a%3c '''%25white%25Mage: the Awakening Book Policy%25%25'''%0a%3c (:cellnr:)%0a%3c *...%0a%3c (:tableend:)%0a%3c [[%3c%3c]]%0a%3c [[#BookPolicyEnd]]%0a%3c %0a%3c [[#Clarifications]]%0a%3c (:table border=0:)%0a%3c (:cellnr bgcolor=#004a80 align=center:)%0a%3c '''%25white%25Clarifications%25%25'''%0a%3c (:cellnr:)%0a%3c *...%0a%3c (:tableend:)%0a%3c [[%3c%3c]]%0a%3c [[#ClarificationsEnd]]%0a%3c %0a%3c [[#Communication]]%0a%3c (:table border=0:)%0a%3c (:cellnr bgcolor=#004a80 align=center:)%0a%3c '''%25white%25Communication%25%25'''%0a%3c (:cellnr:)%0a%3c *...%0a%3c (:tableend:)%0a%3c [[%3c%3c]]%0a%3c [[#CommunicationEnd]]%0a%3c %0a%3c [[#Errata]]%0a%3c (:table border=0:)%0a%3c (:cellnr bgcolor=#004a80 align=center:)%0a%3c '''%25white%25Errata%25%25'''%0a%3c (:cellnr:)%0a%3c *...%0a%3c (:tableend:)%0a%3c [[%3c%3c]]%0a%3c [[#ErrataEnd]]%0a%3c %0a%3c [[#WikiPages]]%0a%3c (:table border=0:)%0a%3c (:cellnr bgcolor=#004a80 align=center:)%0a%3c '''%25white%25Wiki Guidelines%25%25'''%0a%3c (:cellnr:)%0a%3c *...%0a%3c (:tableend:)%0a%3c [[%3c%3c]]%0a%3c [[#WikiPagesEnd]]%0a\ No newline at end of file%0a---%0a> !!Characters%0a\ No newline at end of file%0a

Modern Savannah is built on the lands once held by the Guale Indians. With the Timucua to the South and the Creek Indians to the West, the Gaule held a fertile section of what would eventually become Georgia. Their Lands extended north to the future border of South Carolina and their Eastern extent was the Atlantic Ocean. The Guale had seen the incursion of the French, and of the Spanish, and though their Awakened numbers were small, they were organized under the Leadership of the Guale Shaman known only as ''Hattan''.  ''Hattan'', both a shaman for his people and a Thyrsus, had tilled and worked the land with his own hands, he was a supposed master of the Life and Spirit arcanas, and if the rumors were true, was also a master of prime as well. The lands of the Guale were lush, and were coveted by the Yamasee and Creek tribes. Because of this, the Guale were constantly in a defensive state, not looking to expand their boarders as much as seeking to protect what they already had.%0a%3c %0a%3c It was 1563 and an expedition  led by Jean Ribault, a French naval officer, brought ''Hattan'' in contact with a member of the Awakened from Europe.  Among Ribault’s party was a mage known as ''Gideon''.  ''Gideon'' had joined Ribault’s party as a spiritual advisor, though his other mission was a bit more serious. ''Gideon'' was an advance scout sent by the Paris Consilium meant to make contact with the Awakened in the New World.  Most of ''Gideon’s'' accounts were of modern day South Carolina, but as Ribault moved farther south ''Gideon'' would encounter  ''Hattan'' and the Gaule. Luckily ''Gideon'' was wise enough to come as a supplicant and not a conqueror, and an uneasy friendship was struck up. ''Hattan'' learned of the organization and the size of the European Awakened, and ''Gideon'' learned of something far greater. ''Hattan'' had been shaping the land and the ley lines in a project that had taken most of his life. Slow cultivation of the powerful nodes of Awakened Magic, it was ''Hattan’s'' Mission to create a self-sustaining network of nodes that would nourish the land, and the people in turn.%0a%3c %0a%3c ''Gideon'' was wise enough to display awe instead of a more covetous nature. ''Gideon'' knew he had to report of this experiment to the Paris Consilium, but had no means to do so until Ribault pushed on. Acting as counsel to Ribault, he convinced the French explorer to push farther South and into the lands of the Spaniards in the hopes of contacting more of the Awakened from the old world. With feigned reluctance, ''Gideon'' took his leave of ''Hattan'', a new mission assigned by himself, now of paramount importance.  ''Hattan'', who was cautious, did not know of ''Gideon’s'' f thoughts, and had little choice in what he must do. ''Hattan'' began redoubled his efforts on his project, his goal to see his people prosper and be protected the forefront thought in his mind.%0a%3c %0a%3c ''Gideon'' would continue to travel with Ribault until Ribault and many of his party were ambushed and killed near the Spanish Settlement of St. Augustine. ''Gideon'' was taken “prisoner” by an Awakened member of the Spaniard contingent, an Adamantine Arrow known as ''Falchion''.  ''Falchion'' arranged for ''Gideon’s'' ransom under the guise of ''Gideon'' being a Roman Catholic priest. _''Gideon'' was careful not to mention ''Hattan'' or his project, keeping that information for his superiors. ''Gideon'' feared that the Spanish Awakened would act before he could report his findings to his colleagues in Paris, and so ''Gideon'' waited, suffering the trip across the Atlantic with a barely contained excitement. ''Hattan’s'' work, in this wild and untamed land, was something not seen in Europe, a place where boundaries and cities had been established for centuries.%0a%3c %0a%3c %0a%3c [%25color=#365776%25[[#top| Back to top]]]%0a%3c %0a%3c %0a%3c [[#PT2]]%0a%3c !!Change%0a%3c %0a%3c ''Gideon'' did survive his travel back to the Paris Consilium, but the greeting he expected from his order, and the Consilium, was less than he had hoped for. Seers had pushed against the Paris Consilium, and there was an open war fought with rapier and main gauche, covert spells and assassinations, that filled the streets of Paris. ''Gideon’s'' news of a fantastic experiment in the New World was not worthy enough of his order’s full attention, there was a price in blood that was the forefront thought of the Consilium, and the Consilium had been martialed for war. ''Gideon'', knowing that the war was likely to be a long one, looked for other options. In a series of political moves, ''Gideon'' was assigned as an ambassador of his order to other cities and other Consili. For the next 10 years ''Gideon'' travelled throughout France, looking for a Consilium to fund a voyage back to the New World. He was met with political infighting and skepticism. The Old World had seen, had done, it all. How had such a wild land been able to produce greater works than the Masters of Europe? ''Gideon'' was not a man of prophecy, his knowledge of fate and time was a hindrance, but he had his own vision of ''Hattan’s'' project, one that was for the benefit of the European Awakened as they made it to the New World. It was in desperation that ''Gideon'' made what some might consider a deal with a Devil. It was 1575 when ''Gideon'' left France and made his way to England, specifically, the Consilium of London.%0a%3c %0a%3c The English were much more receptive to the information that ''Gideon''  Provided. There were no English settlements in the New World at this time, and ''Gideon’s'' tales of the new World Sparked an excitement within the Consilium of London. ''Gideon'' would spend the rest of his time in England, knowing that he would be considered a pariah in his home country and the Paris Consilium. Through a network of contacts, ''Gideon'' learned that the Paris Consilium was bled close to dry in the war with the Seers, a war that lasted two years. This was one of the last things ''Gideon'' would learn, he succumbed to the outbreak of Typhus in the city of Oxford in 1577. His work, however, spurred the Awakened to push the English colonization of the New World. In 1578 Walter Raleigh would lead the first expedition to the New World, only to be turned back. It would not be until 1607 that the English would finally make a foothold in North America with the settlement of Jamestown ion 1607.%0a%3c ''Hattan'' had not been idle during this time, though he had become a recluse in many ways. His project took all of his time, the crafting of land pushed his knowledge of the Supernal and of the mundane world to new heights. In the time ''Gideon'' had been gone ''Hattan'' and reshaped and moved nodes, healed and created new ley lines, altered the geography of the land, and worked incessantly on his wonder. His focus was drifting away from the fallen world and was taking him on a path to greater understanding of the supernal. He became a living myth to his people, the shaman of the shamans. There was even talk of him becoming a living ancestor, an avatar of the spirits of the Gaule.%0a%3c %0a%3c While ''Hattan'' delved deeper into the supernal his people fought to survive. Never warlike, the Gaule were hard pressed to survive with the  warlike Creek as their neighbor. First influenced by the French, the Spanish soon took an interest in the Guele and tried desperately to incorporate them into their Mission System of colonization. At first the Guale  seemed to acclimate to the Spanish, but the Guale were too far away from the powerbase the Spanish had in St. Augustine. As a mission province, the Guale were unstable, and in 1597 there was a revolt against the system. Part of the Guale ability to survive was the continued relationship with the French, one kept in secret, which allowed them to avoid the full incorporation into the Spanish System.%0a%3c %0a%3c For a while there was an uneasy balance of power, the Guale continued to survive, but each year saw them holding on with less of a grip to their ancestral lands. The English colonization of the mid-Atlantic was comparatively quick. After the settlement of Jamestown in Virginia the English quickly asserted themselves up and down the Atlantic seaboard. In 1670 the English founded their southernmost settlement with Charleston. By 1675 Indian tribes supported by the British were attacking and destroying missions created by the Spanish. Because this was done by Native Americans the Spanish were unable to hold the English accountable. For most this seemed simple nationalistic combat, countries fighting over new resources. While the Spanish have no record of Awakened involvement, the London Consilium knows full and well that the Awakened pushed many of these combats. They were fueled with the knowledge left behind by ''Gideon'', and their own resources with fate told of a great wonder being created in the lands of the Guale.%0a%3c %0a%3c Though it is not talked about, it is said that an order of Awakened introduced various diseases into the area to force the Guale into capitulation. Small Pox, Typhus, and other diseases ravaged the natives, forcing them to create amalgamation of tribes that would be called the Yamasee.  For several years this group would try to exist despite disease and intertribal warfare.  After the Yamasee wars in South Carolina, and with the British Invasion of Florida in 1702, the Yamasee, nee Guale, were virtually extinct. Of ''Hattan'' and his work there was no word, ''Hattan'' had vanished sometime in the 1600’s and had not been heard of save for the myths and the legends of his people. There was no news of his wonder, or his work. The British were ready to create a settlement, and in 30 years, Savannah would be born.%0a%3c %0a%3c %0a%3c [%25color=#365776%25[[#top| Back to top]]]%0a%3c %0a%3c [[#PT3]]%0a%3c !!Savannah%0a%3c %0a%3c ''Hattan'' had vanished, and it was unknown if his work was finished or not. The area that would become Savannah was teeming with ley energy, Nodes of various sizes had been organized, plotted for some reason that the native Awakened could not divine. Fate Magic, Time, dreaming and trips into the Astral realms gave no clue as to the purpose of ''Hattan’s'' work. His secret had vanished with him, threads of fate had been severed, and his great work was useless to the remaining Awakened among the Native Americans. Right before Oglethorpe would land on American soil a new tribe of Indians, The Yamacraw, would form in preparation for the Arrival of settlers. Tomochichi, the first leader of the Yamacraw, would form his tribe from the survivors of the Yamasee and Creek who had disagreed with the breaking of the Friendship with the British during the Yamasee War. Little did Tomochichi know that the counsel he received was from many Awakened who knew of the impending arrival of English settlers. The tribe built a village near what is modern day Savannah, a supernal guard to make sure that the settlement would go unobstructed.%0a%3c %0a%3c James Oglethorpe arrived in 1732 with 114 colonists in tow. Several members of the Awakened were present, most notably the Mysterium and the Adamantine Arrow. The first act of these European Awakened was to contact their brethren in the Yamacraw. The resulted in the peaceful moving of the Yamacraw tribe farther North along the Savannah River, thus giving the Europeans free reign in the area. These plans all came from ''Gideon’s'' notes, his ideas, and his plans there were laid out almost 150 years prior to the arrival of the English. ''Hattan’s'' project was taken without bloodshed, and immediately the Awakened went to work.%0a%3c %0a%3c Some would like to think that Oglethorpe himself was a mage. The layout of Savannah was unique in its day, and remains so even now. %0a%3c %0a%3c http://wantonwicked.gamingsandbox.com/wiki/images/mta/history/mtahistory1.jpg%0a%3c %0a%3c The plan for the city was unlike earlier settlements, and built one stage atop the other in an ordered form. This unnatural city design, the way that it appeared to be geometrically and numerically precise and the way it captured the nodes left behind by ''Hattan'' was not unintentional, but it was not Oglethorpe who was the mage,%0a%3c %0a%3c %25lfloat text-align=center margin-top=5px margin-right=15px margin-bottom=5px margin-left=0px%25http://wantonwicked.gamingsandbox.com/wiki/images/mta/history/mtahistory2.jpg%0a%3c Each ward was preconceived  before the settlers had ever set foot on American soil, the note left by ''Gideon'' and ample use of Space and fate magic gave the travelling Awakened a virtual map to design with. Once they arrived they quickly adapted their plans and set forth in creating the street and block pattern that Savannah is now famous for. Oglethorpe, thinking the idea his own, quickly implemented this project, but it was the subtle guidance of the mages ''Ledger'' and ''Dragoon'' that gave Oglethorpe inspiration. %0a%3c %0a%3c Savannah quickly took shape, and while the European Awakened could not fathom ''Hattan’s'' plans any more than their Native American counterparts, they did create a wonder of their own. As the lands were shaped for the buildings and roads the ley lines began to move. Subtle changes at first, but the nodes and the lines began to parallel the creation of the city. Within a decade there were 12 wards, each one centered atop a node, ley lines of consistent power flowing between them, and then, something truly wondrous happened. Wondrous, and very dangerous.%0a%3c %0a%3c Hallows began to appear, producing tass in various forms, and then they would vanish. The Node system appeared to act as a battery, generating arcane power until it was full before a Hallow would appear and the mana would coalesce into tass. The first of these hallows appeared in 1745, twelve years after the founding of the city, but only 5 years after the completion of the last ward. The few Guardians of the Veil in the city were quick and careful to act, using smoke and mirrors to distract the populace as the Mysterium went to work harvesting the Tass. The hallow stayed active for a week, but the amount of tass retrieved before it disappearance was rumored to be 50 pawns. Had the Awakened stumbled on the purpose of ''Hattan’s''  Project? Did ''Hattan'' understand the concept of a battery well before one had ever been made?  The Consilium of Savannah met immediately after the hallow disappeared, their number was small, only 10 members largely comprised of the Mysterium and the Adamantine Arrow. The Guardians of the Veil member counseled caution, to wait and see if the event would happen again, before then deciding to tell other Consili about this wonder. The Silver Ladder balked at the Idea, wanting to share the information, and the wealth of the new world, to earn a place among the larger established Consili by right of their wonder. The Arrow agreed with the Guardians, their number was not great and there would be those who would try and take the wonder by force. They did not avoid the confrontation, but they counseled that only the desperate created a war they would lose. The Mysterium… said nothing. %0a%3c %0a%3c Eventually the compromise on patience won out, though party did agree to inform parent Consili and other Consili of this wonder should it repeat itself. The orders waited, the city grew, and time passed. There was certain anxiousness in the air for the first few years after the event. The Awakened watched as the ley lines seem to establish themselves. Geomancers among the wise were amazed at the intricate network that seemed vibrant enough to be self-contained.  Powerful lines left the city, heading towards South Carolina and the city of Charlestown, as well as to the West, towards what would become Atlanta. Another major artery headed south, into the Spanish territory of Florida. But the ley lines did not take magic in as much as they pushed magic out, Instead of one large node like a power plant, there was a grid of nodes producing enough ley energy that the stream only seemed to head away  from Savannah. The area around the city flourished, there were good yields in crops and in fauna. ''Hattan’s'' efforts, for whatever reason, had created something vibrant, something alive. There was less disease, fewer deaths from age, and people, in general, found a good life in Savannah.%0a%3c %0a%3c 1760, Fifteen years after the first hallow appeared, in the middle of a storm that had bracketed the coast for days, the second hallow appeared. Once again the Awakened quickly worked together, distracting the mortal population, which had grown since the last event, while harvesting the tass in the middle of the storm. Again, the Hallow remained active for a week, The awakened very carefully directed people away from the area, claiming other areas of the town needed assistance before working in the area the hallow had appeared. It was not the same location as the time before, instead appearing in a different ward.  This time the haul was larger, 75 pawns of tass pulled in just under a week. Each one carefully cultivated and separated from the Hallow. There were other more traditional hallows about Savannah, they would stay active if tended, and some cabals had found and tended to them for years, but nothing like these hallows produced by the node network.%0a%3c %0a%3c Just as before, the Consilium met, this time their numbers had grown, it had been years, and 20 awakened now returned to the argument of what to do with the knowledge, and the wonder, that they had found.%0a%3c %0a%3c http://wantonwicked.gamingsandbox.com/wiki/images/mta/history/mtahistory3.jpg%0a%3c %0a%3c %0a%3c %0a%3c [%25color=#365776%25[[#top| Back to top]]]%0a%3c %0a%3c [[#PT4]]%0a%3c !!Debate%0a%3c %0a%3c Savannah was larger, the Consilium was established and growing, and the hallows, with their caches of tass, had again appeared 15 years to the day after the first sighing of what some now called “''Hattan'' Hallows.” The Consilium had agreed to discuss what should be done if the event had occurred again, and  true to its word, the debate began. It was not a simple thing, instead a long and arduous process that divided orders on how they should respond. The worst division was in the Mysterium, some wanted to hide the wonder, study it, reverse engineer it workings. They believed that, in time, they could decipher the spells and the components of a device that did not appear to have a physical form. Others in the Mysterium felt that it was foolish not to utilize the resources of the order, to use the knowledge held in the Athenaeums of other cities. It was as close to kin-strife as it could be, with no few duels occurring because of slights, both supposed and real. The representatives of the other orders watched this internal war, smaller version of it playing out within their own orders. The Silver Ladder wanted to announce the wonder as a jewel of the Savannah Consilium, their idea was to parlay its existence for a bigger stake in the new colonies and for legitimization in the old world. Politics all the way, the Ladder had a few among them who cautioned with words like “Hubris” and “Hamartia.” The Adamantine Arrow, surprisingly, was also divided. There were those who felt that their defense of an object, a wonder such as this, was a way to gain recognition. The desire to sacrifice for the Consilium and the wise in service rang true in the ears of many, while others counseled patience, that the knowledge of such a wonder would draw more than just idle attention and curiosity. One of the few orders without strife was the Guardians of the Veil. They sought to protect the sleeping world from the machinations of the Awakened, and their policy was simple: hide what needed hidden, protect the Veil, and protect the Consilium.%0a%3c %0a%3c The final decision, reached a year after the Hallows had appeared and vanished, was made, and knowledge of the wonder was spread to various Consili. In North America an Envoy was sent first to South Carolina, Charleston being the nearest neighboring Consilium, before moving on to Jamestown and eventually Boston. Another envoy was sent to Europe, visiting the Consili of England. The Awakened of Savannah agreed that their work would not be shared with the French or Spanish Consili, some mundane superstitions and national pride still remained. The envoy to the Americas returned in just over a year, their travels brought with them a handful of new Awakened, mostly of the Mysterium and the Silver Ladder, but also returned with the most interesting of attitudes. The Northern Consili had reacted to the story of ''Hattan’s'' wonder with suspicion, with denial that something so grand would be found in the youngest of the Colonies. The Boston Consilium was the worst with,  “an attitude of superiority that was thicker than fresh butter” or so the envoy said. Those who arrived were welcomed, and offered chances to join the Savannah Consilium. Most of them, younger mages, took the opportunity with relish, like indentured servants being offered freedom, the mages agree and set to earning their way in the growing city. %0a%3c %0a%3c A year and a half later the envoy from Europe returned. The skepticism in Europe was even greater than that of Northern American Consili. The Envoy returned with stories of at least one duel, little in the way of support, but a chest of potential information for the budding Athenaeum from a sympathetic Mystagogue. The Silver Ladder hope of prestige was crushed, the Arrow desire for service was quelled and the Mysterium, which had fought long and hard with itself, licked its wounds in silence. The Guardians of the Veil, not yet numerous, stayed consistent with business as usual.  The Consilium grew, the work continued and the calendar was watched. Two times might have been happenstance; a third would be a pattern. In the remaining decade and some years the Awakened continued to grow, continued to work.  The secrecy of ''Hattan'' and the skill of his work eluded many of even the brightest minds researching the wonder. Time moved on, and Savannah believed that its overtures had been forgotten.%0a%3c %0a%3c %0a%3c [%25color=#365776%25[[#top| Back to top]]]%0a%3c %0a%3c [[#PT5]]%0a%3c !!Revolution%0a%3c %0a%3c 1775, and almost to the day, the Hallows once again appeared. Though, this time, there was more in the air than the excitement of another find. Once again the Hallows had appeared during the storm season, the winds and rains announcing the coming of a severe season were not the only terror that hung unseen in the future. The tensions between the Colonies and the parent were building. Those in Savannah knew there was something on the horizon, the Enchanters and those versed in time studied the signs, the omens, and it was on their words that the Consilium acted. The Acanthi saw the coming conflict, they saw the shrouded horsemen who travelled with every army sense time memorial.  Savannah would first fall, and then stand, its blood would run because of the actions of allies, and not of enemies. The Consilium prepared by harvesting the tass, now a little over 100 pawns, in the week the hallows remained. It was the third time this had happened, and the third time that the hallows had appeared in a different square. There was not enough information to predict which square, which ward of Savannah the hallow would appear in, but the timing was set, 15 years.%0a%3c %0a%3c The Mysterium went to looking into why 15 years might be significant. The number held no special weight with the Native American tribes, and there was nothing that seemed to tie it to the old world. The researchers continued, and in a daring move, helped fund the addition of another ward, this time with Mysterium and Sleepwalker workers excavating the ground among side the sleeping workforce. The project was a rush, how much could be done before the impending hostilities began. It was a tough time, there were many of the Wise who wished to counsel the Mayor and the Governor, warning them that there would be a time of violence, but to do so would threaten the secrecy of the Awakened. They instead waited, hiding caches of Tass should they be needed during the coming days.%0a%3c %0a%3c The ward was not finished when the American Revolution began, and within 2 years of the initial blows, Savannah found itself under the guns of the British Army.  3,000 men under the command of Colonel Archibald Campbell, laid siege to the city of Savannah during December of 1778, with Campbell’s army was a small cabal of Awakened, their presence was not a surprise, but their actions were. Campbell routed the Colonial forces and took possession of the city where he then proved to be a cosmopolitan and kind governor. He displayed an urbane method of treatment, allowing people to carry on with their daily lived with little intervention. He did not recruit or try to turn the population back into royal citizens, and would eventually return Savannah to the control of its then Royal Governor, James Wright.%0a%3c %0a%3c Campbell and his army would eventually move north to Aid in the pacification of South Carolina, Charleston especially, leaving a token force behind in Savannah. The city had not fulfilled the prophecy of bloodshed, and the new Cabal of Mages, all of them from England did nothing to change this. The Cabal of the Hidden Seam was a group of Mysterium and Arrows from Newcastle upon Tyne. Four men in all 2 from each order and representing the Moroi and Obrimoi paths, they had heard of the Savannah Envoy to England well after the envoy had returned to America. With time, and some effort, they had studied the information that had been left by the envoy with the Manchester and Edinburgh Consili, and they had decided to come to America to study the wonder. Even though they were part of the “invading” or “occupying” army, they swore an allegiance to the Consilium of Savannah and worked within the British Army to make the occupation a show of force. In all honesty, compared to other American cities, Savannah was spared the worst… for a while.%0a%3c %0a%3c Immediately the new members of the Consili proved that they were not there in name only. The four had copied and transcribed information recorded in the English Athenaeums, storing them in the ghost realm so that they would not be lost to the sea or to an army. They set to work reclaiming and reconstituting the information that they had hidden, adding greatly to the Athenaeum and its existing library. Their work was done in haste, it was only a matter of time before the Americans arrived to reclaim the city. Though the 4 Wise were saddened to learn that they had just missed the Hallows, they were buoyed by the opportunity to study and possibly witness the next advent of ''Hattan’s'' wonder. Stay true to the fifteen year cycle, they would only need to wait for 12 years, 12 years that they had no issue devoting to study. Their exuberance buoyed the Consilium   and all the orders set to creating new Identities for the four awakened so that come the end of hostilities, they could quickly fall into the fold.%0a%3c %0a%3c A year after Savannah fell to the British the American, with French allies, tried to retake the city. These were the nights of blood that the Enchanters saw. The American’s shelled the city, Artillery being used to disrupt the British only served to hammer the citizens and their homes. The assault failed with major casualties for the Americans and French. The Consilium used this time to try and sneak the cabal of British soldiers away from combat and into hiding, listing them among the lost in the combat. Sadly, one of the Arrows did indeed perish, but the three remaining members of the cabal survived and quietly took residence in Savannah as if they had been there all along.%0a%3c %0a%3c Savannah would remain in British hands until 1782 and it would be 8 years until the next advent of the ''Hattan'' Hallows. The Revolutionary war ended, and Savannah rebuilt. The Hallows did indeed return in 1790 and again in 1805, 1820, 1835 and then in 1850. Each year saw the amount of Tass increase, sometimes by just a few pawns, sometimes nearly doubling. A correlation was found, the amount of tass produced by the Hallows was directly proportional to the population. When the population so did the production of Tass, this idea was first thought off in 1820 when an epidemic of Yellow Fever tore through Savannah.   %0a%3c %0a%3c %0a%3c [%25color=#365776%25[[#top| Back to top]]]%0a%3c %0a%3c [[#PT6]]%0a%3c !!Growth%0a%3c %0a%3c Savannah continued to grow along with the rest of the United States. The hard won independence from England gave the new country its various freedoms along with new sets of problems. The first few years were difficult, but slowly a strong nation took shape. From the end of the Revolution and on into the early 1800’s there were times of prosperity, times were the wonder of the still new land amazed its inhabitants. This is not to say there were not problems. A series of wars with the Native Americans; The Creek War of 18131814, the First (181718) and Second (1835184 Seminole War eroded the goodwill that had once existed in Georgia between the settlers and the Native Americans. The War of 1812, again with England had a lasting effect in Georgia, one that would continue to rear its head for years to come.%0a%3c %0a%3c England had occupied Georgia easily during the revolution, and there was great fear that England would do so again in the War of 1812. While defenses were erected they were poorly equipped, maintained, and the communication between them was horrendous. The English Navy, then the most powerful navy the world had seen, had little trouble forming a blockade along the Eastern seaboard of the United States, including Savannah. The English made landfall at Cumberland, South of Savannah and North of what is now Jacksonville. Before the army could move north, the treaty of Ghent had been signed, and the War of 1812 was over, again, the effects would be felt for some time.%0a%3c %0a%3c During the occupation of Cumberland Island the British forces had conducted raids in Southern Georgia, freeing slaves and inciting rebellion against the state. After the war there was a time of turmoil as Georgians looked to quell these rebellions, and in a manner fit only for that time, “recapture their property.” It was a deplorable time, but slavery was far from being abolished, and the human trafficking would continue through the early 1800’s.  More and more legislation, or a Federal level, came into play regarding slavery, legislation that irritated the Southern States who relied so very heavily on slaves in their agrarian industry. It was a time heading for a boiling point, one that again loomed over the horizon.%0a%3c %0a%3c The Slavery issue affected the Consilium and the Wise as well, the first African Awakened in Savannah during the 1840’s. Sadly the racism that was rampant in the mundane world was not absent in the Awakened world. While the Savannah Consilium had accepted Native American Awakened, mostly in the form of Thyrsus and Acanthus members, the Awakening of a Slave caused difficulties the Consilium did not foresee.  The Consilium had to adapt, there was no doubt the woman, now called ''Orixa'', was Awakened, but she was still a slave, a piece of property of another, and the very idea shook the foundation of the Consilium. The debate over what to do with ''Orixa'' raged in the Consilium for a month until finally the order head of the Adamantine Arrow, an aged Adamant Sage known as Onager stepped to the fore of the discussion. Citing that ''Orixa'' already knew what it was like to live in constant conflict, and that she Awakened despite adversity and anyone else’s attempt to stop her, that she would have a home in the Adamantine Arrow, and that anyone who wished to contest his acceptance of this newly Awakened  woman was welcome to send their seconds to formally duel him.%0a%3c %0a%3c Many considered Onager a madman with this act, and Consilium records show that he had no less than three formal duels for his actions, three duels that he won in a fashion that his Obrimos nature could call divine intervention. ''Orixa'' joined the Adamantine Arrow, training first under Onager, but as her power and prowess grew, under her newly accepting family. ''Orixa'' was the first, but she was not the last. The Consilium records were not known to record the race of the Awakened in Savannah, but there was mention of color regarding no less than five members by 1850.  %0a%3c %0a%3c By the 1850’s, the Consilium was more cosmopolitan, at least in their own meetings, while continuing to appear to mundane friends and family as divided on the class distinction caused by race. There were still those who believed that those of color, any color, were inferior, and their attitudes were barely hidden at times, but the will of the Hierarch, and the strength of various members of the Consilium kept these views in check, save for one incident. During the late 1850’s there was a murder in the Consilium, supposedly spurred by an interracial relationship.  Consilium history is thin on evidence of the events, but there was, for the first time in Savannah, an Awakened killed by another Awakened. The names involved were removed from the History, and the event was, quickly covered up.%0a%3c %0a%3c %0a%3c [%25color=#365776%25[[#top| Back to top]]]%0a%3c %0a%3c [[#PT7]]%0a%3c !!Civil War%0a%3c %0a%3c 1850 saw another series of ‘’Hattan'' Hallows appear and the haul was the largest amount of Tass collected yet. Savannah had a population of over 15,000, making it the largest city in Southeastern Georgia. The total population of the State was close to 525,000 and would grow in the next 10 years to over 1 million people.  From 1850 to 1860 the Obrimos of Savannah quietly worked on mapping the ley lines of Savannah, a project that had been started and stopped many times before. By 1860 the map was done, and it was strange in a way that surprised no one. The map showed an almost perfect grid aligned with the construction of the wards in downtown Savannah. From there, spoke appeared to head off, the spokes were strong, thicker in some ways, than the lines connecting the grid in downtown Savannah. It was during this time that another aspect of ''Hattan’s'' project was noticed. None of the ley line spokes; which appeared to head to Charleston, Sc. via Hilton Head, to Macon then on to Atlanta, Ga., and another to Columbia, Ga., none of the spokes returned power to Savannah. The Ley Lines appeared to be one way, and one way only, emanating outwards from the city. The Surprise did not end there, but in 1855, with the expansion of Jacksonville Florida, a new spoke appeared leaving the Southern Tip of the City and heading towards the younger Floridian City. The confirmation that the new line did indeed make it all the way to Jacksonville was establish by 1860, the same year that it was confirmed that the other spokes made their ways to the other cities.%0a%3c %0a%3c While these surprises were positive moment in the lives of the Wise, there were again the Omens of conflict and war. The argument on races, on color, had reached a fever pitch in the Congress. Threats had been made, if a man by the name of Abraham Lincoln ascended to the Presidency, there would be repercussions. The Wise of Savannah were not perfect, they had started, albeit slowly, to accent the Awakened amongst the slave population, but it was still slow to change. The idea of Slavery was abhorrent to many, yet seemed to be accepted based on the color of one’s skin. The Awakened were changing, unlike the sleepers around them, but they had to be careful not to let it show. It was a difficult time, and was about to get worse. The American Civil War began because of the City of Charleston, and among them the wise of Charleston, fired upon Fort Sumter in the Charleston harbor. Secession began, and Georgia would be the fifth of Eleven States to secede from the Union.%0a%3c %0a%3c At first the secession appeared to work, the battles, fought mostly in Virginia and Tennessee, were far enough away that one could almost believe there was not fighting going on. The war took its toll, and one year became five, a blockade once again stifled commerce, and the population dwindled as men went off to never return. Then, in 1864, the unthinkable happened. William Tecumseh Sherman took Control of Atlanta Georgia in September of 1864, and breaking with tradition, did not collect his forces and move towards a secure port for provisions. Instead, he began his “March to the Sea,” heading toward the Atlantic. Most of Georgia did not know his true intentions, but the Wise of Savannah did, the end of the march would bring Sherman to Savannah. Sherman waged a war unlike any seen before him, a new concept known as Total War, nothing escaped the sword where he went and the Wise were aware of this.%0a%3c %0a%3c The Awakened were also aware that there were no few number of Northern Awakened travelling with Sherman’s Army. While some of the Awakened were bound to be from Consili in the North, the Wise in Savannah felt there would also be those who did not follow the ways of the Diamond orders. A sacking was in the making, but the problem, for the wise of Savannah, was that there was nothing left to sack. ''Hattan’s'' Hallows would not appear for another year and they most certainly did not want an occupying army in the city when that happened. By November Sherman was drawing near and something had to be done.%0a%3c %0a%3c It was two Awakened of the Mysterium, an Obrimos, ''Flare'', and a Moros, ''Locust'', who proposed a solution. Both had studied the wonder left by ''Hattan'' since their acceptance into the Mysterium. ''Flare'' had been one of the many Obrimos who had studied the ley lines and their odd conveyance of energy and ''Locust'' had tried to relearn the ancient prime focused earth-sculpting that ''Hattan'' had mastered. It was their thought that the device left by ''Hattan'' could be “turned off” for a limited amount of time. That the wonder could be diverted so that hallows did not appear, potentially strengthening the ley lines to other cities, but reducing the creation of tass in Savannah, thus hiding the true wonder from an Invading army. With the Hierarch’s blessing they began to work. %0a%3c %0a%3c ''Flare'' made notes on everything that he and ''Locust'' did. Rumor has it they forged rods of adamantine imbued with prime, rods said to be “three times the height of a man and as thick around as an arm… .” It took time. They were hurried, but they did not rush. The rods were to act like pins inside a lock, each one set at a different spot, a different depth. The rods, once set in place, would be hidden from mage sight, their threads cut so that no one mage could remove them without knowing where they were placed. The work was complete during the last days of November 1864, Sherman’s army was near the periphery of Savannah. The Awakened of Savannah prepared a delegation to ride out and meet with the approaching Wise. As the delegation left ''Flare'' and ''Locust'' went to work, placing the rods inside the nodes, the pattern kept secret only to be passed along to the Hierarch themselves. %0a%3c %0a%3c The delegation of Southern awakened was welcomed by their Northern counterparts. Conversation was cordial, concern about their health and the strength of the Consilium seemed to be the first topic of Conversation. There was no mention about ''Hattan’s'' at first, instead, business was done the old way, the, surprisingly, Southern way. At the mention of the wonder it was one of the Northern Awakened who answered the hanging question. The Northern Wise were there to help the Consilium of Savannah protect the wonder. Auguries and precognitions in the North had omens of a great wonder, hidden in the lands of the wayward sleepers that would come under attack from within. Since Savannah was the only city with such a wonder, and since earlier communication had never been responded to, the Consili had drafted men from the Western Consili to try and make it to Savannah.%0a%3c %0a%3c The Southern Awakened were shocked, they denied having ever received an inquiry or a message regarding this dire event. A panic took over the collected wise and the members from the Savannah Consilium, with an escort from the Northern Wise, returned to Savannah with all haste. There they found that events had transpired worse than they could imagine. ''Locust'' was dead, left murdered in Liberty Square. Of ''Flare'', there was no word. The research that went along with the project, the location of the adamantine rods, everything had been taken or destroyed. The Athenaeum had been attacked, parts of the building smoldered from arcane blasts, the inside held strong, but there was no way those inside could have known what was going on. The deed had been done, there were too many questions, not enough answers.%0a%3c %0a%3c Savannah surrendered to Sherman December of 1864, Sherman, like Campbell before him, was charitable towards the citizens of Savannah, he did as he promised, and showed Mercy, leaving the city intact. Within a Month he was gone, marching into South Carolina on his continued campaign. Among those he left behind were the dozen or so Awakened from the North. With their help, a manhunt began. The trail left by ''Flare'', was obscured, but was not impossible to track. During this search many things came to light. ''Flare'' had been a Seer, originally from the South he was Northern educated, more time and more resources were spent tracking this lone mage down. The next year, 1865, during the appointed month, the Hallows did not appear. The sorrow was equaled in anger, the despair matched with rage. The Consilium of Savannah, as a whole, declared Nemesis on the Awakened Seer known as ''Flare'', and sent this declaration to all surviving established Consili in both the North and the South. The Civil War ended, but a hidden war was just being born.%0a%3c %0a%3c 1865 passed, as did 1880, and then 1895, the third cycle was again missed, the Hallows didn’t appear, but there was a conclusion to the story started 31 years prior. ''Flare'' was eventually found in Chicago in 1895. In the 30 years he had been on the lamb, members of the Savannah Consilium had destroyed no less than 15 pylons and disrupted multiple tetrarchies in their pursuit of this one mage. Some of the lost work had been recovered, or copies of the notes made about the project, were occasionally acquired, but ''Flare'' had escaped notice. ''Flare'' had been bartering knowledge for protection and power, but it did nothing to protect him from a wrath of a city. Members of the Savannah Adamantine Arrow cornered ''Flare'' in Rockford Park, Chicago, and forced him to combat. ''Flare'' died in December 1895, taking with him most of the information he had stolen to his grave. That would seem to be sad, but fitting end, to the Seer who had committed such an act against the Consilium of Savannah, but it was not the end. Two Mysterium Moros were with the arrow at ''Flare’s''’ demise, the chained and bound his soul, brought him back the Athenaeum, and proceeded to strip the information from his remaining mind before finally destroying him. It was not one of the better moments for the Mysterium, but it brought closure to a dark Chapter in the history of the city.%0a%3c %0a%3c %0a%3c [%25color=#365776%25[[#top| Back to top]]]%0a%3c %0a%3c [[#PT8]]%0a%3c !!The Free Council%0a%3c %0a%3c The Reconstruction was hard on the South, especially in Georgia where Sherman had taken life by the throat, shaken it repeatedly and thrown it on the ground. Savannah had escaped the physical violence that Atlanta, Columbia and other cities had experience, but the psychological damage was still there. A way of life had been shattered, and to make the recovery more complex, there were those in the North who took advantage of the situation. Charleston was the premier port on the Eastern seaboard but Savannah still made major contributions in foodstuffs, and of course, cotton.%0a%3c %0a%3c The loss of the Hallows changed the Consilium in some ways, the Mysterium became focused on recovering the information stolen and destroyed by ''Flare''. Of the five rods sank into the nodes 2 had been found, and they still remained. Somehow the rods had bonded with the nodes, becoming hard to distinguish between the two. There was no idea on how to separate them, and if ''Flare'' did know, not even his ghost gave up that information. The Consilium developed an entire section of their Athenaeum to the study of the wonder. They became withdrawn for some time, the object of their studies had been sullied under their noses and they grew despondent after ''Flare'' was destroyed. The hopes of regaining some of the lost knowledge had buoyed them, and the drop from hope was felt by the entire order. The Silver Ladder worked hard to hold things together, to try and stave off the melancholy caused by rebuilding. The Guardians of the Veil and the Arrows, both having been on war footing for so long, took time to acclimate back into society. It was a difficult era, a time of confusion and questions.%0a%3c %0a%3c Odd that this occurred during the same time as the birth of the Free Council, a time during the refusal, when so many Wise were disillusioned with the old way, looking for something new, something that they could hold on to. The Birth of Free Council was keenly felt in Savannah, many decided that the old ways were not for them, had cost them too much. The apostasy to join this fledgling order hit the Mysterium the hardest, followed closely by the Arrow and even some Ladders and Guardians felt the need to change. In other cities, where there was bloodshed and violence, there was a malaise that was hanging over Savannah, one that took the wind out of sails. The Free Council was not exactly accepted, but it was barely fought. For once apathy successfully stopped violence and bloodshed, but the spiral the Consilium and the Wise were in was not healthy. For close to 40 years the Consilium had been at war, the loss of an enemy was also a loss of identity as they had used resource after resource to chase after ''Flare''. They needed to regroup, and it was the Seers who once again provided them with the opportunity.%0a%3c %0a%3c It was the most mundane thing really, the Boll Weevil, a form of beetle that seemed unassuming, yet was incredibly destructive, was the enemy. In 1915 small infestations begin to appear in Savannah’s cotton farms. By 1920 it is epidemic proportions. At first the Thyrsus Silver Ladder and the Mysterium sought to contain the Weevil’s using life magic, but it was apparent that this was something more than just an infestation. It was the members of the Free Council, looking for answers outside of nature and the overt, that saw the hands of the Seers of the Throne involved with the Weevil infestation. Once again the Seers were attacking Savannah, trying to destroy its use to the Diamond, now Pentacle orders. The Free Council became the vanguard in the fight not only against the insect infestation, but against the Seers themselves. This dedication to the other Awakened gave rise to the spirits of the Consilium members, once again they had a common purpose, and again they were united. %0a%3c %0a%3c The Destruction of crops was rampant, but once again Savannah survived. The Consilium had been taxed heavily, but it too survived. The Free Council was accepted, faster than many other Consili had accepted the upstart order. Savannah would continue on.%0a%3c %0a%3c The ''Hattan'' Hallows did not appear in 1910, nor in 1925 or 1940. By 1940 the Consilium was strong again and the population of Savannah had grown to almost 100,000 people and the Consilium had grown to match. A new conflict was waiting in the wings, one that would take place far away from Savannah, but a conflict that would still have an effect on the city. War spread across Europe, and the Consilium prepared to send aid to its one time parent Consili in England. Since 1860 Savannah had spent more than 40 years in one form of conflict or another. They had experience in survival, in fortitude, and they could feel, even without arcana, the weight that was pressing against Europe. %0a%3c %0a%3c %0a%3c [%25color=#365776%25[[#top| Back to top]]]%0a%3c %0a%3c [[#PT9]]%0a%3c !!The Sacking of the Athenaeum%0a%3c %0a%3c World Wars I and II passed, and then there was Korea. The fighting was abroad, Vietnam was beginning to build, and the effect was felt stateside in a variety of ways. There was constant conflict yet none of it at home, at least, nothing like the battlefields in Europe and Asia. A different war was brewing at home, Civil Rights, the age old question of color taken to a national level by the likes of Rosa Parks, Martin Luther King Jr., and Malcolm X rocked the nation with act of civil disobedience and speeches. The nation felt the stamp of a million feet, Georgia did not escape this time of change, nor did Savannah.%0a%3c %0a%3c While Atlanta took a spotlight with marches and protests, Savannah quietly persevered. The work done in the 1800’s by the Consilium had done much for equal right among the awakened, and now the mortal population was keeping up. The Consilium used their magic, carefully, to smooth out tensions, to ease the people into a future. Massive works of mind and life, fate and time, were cast around the city, the Consilium did not want Savannah to see another siege, this time from within. By 1940 Savannah’s population was over 50%25 black or of mixed race, one of the largest percentages in America, The Consilium saw the writing on the wall, the transition to a new day was smoother than in other cities, some hatreds and fear could never be defeated, but that was not Savannah’s problem.%0a%3c %0a%3c The Hallows did not return in 1940, nor did they return in 1955. For a while there was hope, the nodes seemed to grow stronger with the increase in population, the Ley Lines pulsed with an amazing brilliance and Prime users found ways to siphon off some of the residual energy. It was during this time that the modern day Savannah Athenaeum was founded. The building that still houses the Mysterium’s grand library was built, and during one quiet night, over half of its power supply was converted from electricity to energy from a nearby node. It was a grand time, the lore recovered from chasing ''Flare'' added with the nearly 300 years of history and study, made the Savannah Athenaeum one of the great treasures of the Southeast. The subject were many, Ghost and spirits, native American occult, the ''Hattan'' Project, the Weevil wars, Southern Cooking and even a section on the Seers. What made the library special was not the ''Hattan'' information, but a section dedicated entirely to omens, oracles and auguries that had been recorded since the founding of the City. Sometimes these portents were not understood until the event was happen, the predictions were many and varied; often esoteric or hidden in gibberish. Some of the records were never understood, and the members of the Mysterium did not know if that was because the events they describe had not taken place, or the translation was just wrong.%0a%3c %0a%3c Despite the racial tensions, the Consilium was strong. It had weathered many storms, and it had persevered and continued to grow. Not as large as Charleston or Atlanta, and spared the ravage of the Civil War and Sherman’s march, Savannah was a bastion of the Old South. For some time there truly was peace in the city, which made the events in 1962 even more shocking.%0a%3c %0a%3c In what could only be called a fit of madness an Awakened Mage  studying in the Athenaeum set fire to the room containing the oracles as well as much of the information on ''Hattan’s'' wonder. This was the second time the pages of information were lost, and this time, due to the Awakeneds' knowledge of death, they truly were lost. Members of the Mysterium tried to subdue the Magi; two died in the attempt and one more never regained their sanity. The used of mastery levels of time and fate was awesome to behold, terrifying yet awesome, and the remaining Mystagogue had a choice; save their Athenaeum or fight the magus. They chose to save their works and the Wise, whose name has been lost to time, with threads and fate hiding them away from others, fled. %0a%3c %0a%3c The magus took nothing with them, at least that is what was thought. There is strong suspicion that “the Eternal Now” or a variant was used. Many conflicting thoughts and memories of the event remained. No two stories seemed to add up, and when the Mysterium looked through its ranks, no one could remember enough to identify the mage who performed this act. What was known was this was not an attack by the Seers of the Throne, this was not a theft. The magus, male or female was never agreed on, vanished, leaving nothing behind and taking nothing, to the knowledge of curators, with them. Instead they left ash and death, there was no vengeance like there was on ''Flare'', to be had. The Mysterium licked its wounds, saved what it could, and put safeguards in play that would never allow this event to happen again.%0a%3c %0a%3c %0a%3c [%25color=#365776%25[[#top| Back to top]]]%0a%3c %0a%3c [[#PT10]]%0a%3c !!Turn of the Century%0a%3c %0a%3c Savannah grew quiet for many years, the city continued to grow, out shadowed by Atlanta as Georgia’s premier city. Atlanta was the capital, the switch had occurred over 100 years ago, and Savannah seemed to move along just a little slows after the transition. By the latter half of the 20th century Savannah had become the fourth largest city behind Atlanta, Augusta and Columbia. If there was a depreciation in prestige it was not felt, Savannah was still the first city of Georgia, and in many ways, its jewel. The Athenaeum rebuilt, the Consilium grew, and the city, in many ways was thriving.%0a%3c %0a%3c Sadly, the actions taken by the Consilium in pursuing ''Flare'' after the Civil War had earned it animosity outside of the normal antagonism between the Pentacle and the Seers of the Throne. The early 1980’s saw a refusal war for the city conducted between the Adamantine Arrows and the Guardians of the Veil against the Seers of the Throne. Casualties mounted, the Adamantine Arrow taking the brunt of the damage. By the mid-nineties the Arrow was spent, achieving a hollow victory in holding the city with their order shattered. It was at this time that the future Adamant Sage ''Kreig'' appeared in Savannah. Through sheer force of will he rebuilt and reformed the Arrow. The Guardians had fared better, but their shadow war with the Seers continued. %0a%3c %0a%3c The final act of the refusal war was the refurbishing of Coastal State Prison, a Federal Correctional institution that the Seers entrenched themselves in. A peace, if you would call it that, was called, though neither side ever completely gave up on the eternal war between the dogmatic factions. The Arrows rebuilt and restructured, ''Kreig’s'' methods were efficient and the Seers retreated behind the walls of bureaucracy.  A watchful peace was still a peace, and the Consilium continued to grow.%0a%3c %0a%3c In the late nineties ''Titus'' of the Silver Ladder ascended to the Hierarch, and for a while there was a “Golden Age” for the Consilium. After so many struggles, after years of conflict, both mundane and supernal, the city seemed at peace. The enemy was near, but they were known. The works of the Mysterium flourished, the Free Council created changed, the Guardians of the Veil hid the works of the wise from the mundane world, the Adamantine Arrow waited, ready to defend, and the Silver Ladder lead by example. For the moment the Consilium was stable, strong, and in league with one another to make the city a better place for Wise and sleeper alike.%0a%3c %0a%3c The calm was enjoyed by many, the peace a treat after so many years of struggle and adversity. The hallows had not returned and for a moment that was not a worry. Many dedicated themselves to the study of the ancient wonder, Mysterium mages found able and willing helpers from the other orders in trying to unravel the work of ''Flare''. For some, worry set in, it is always calm before a storm, and while many wished to forget, some would not.%0a%3c %0a%3c %0a%3c [%25color=#365776%25[[#top| Back to top]]]%0a%3c %0a%3c [[#PT11]]%0a%3c !!Modern Nights%0a%3c %0a%3c Coming Soon%0a%3c %0a%3c [%25color=#365776%25[[#top| Back to top]]]%0a%3c [[#HistoryEnd]]%0a%3c %0a%3c [[#Fiction]]%0a%3c (:table border=0:)%0a%3c (:cellnr bgcolor=#004a80 align=center:)%0a%3c '''%25white%25Fiction%25%25'''%0a%3c (:cellnr:)%0a%3c *...%0a%3c (:tableend:)%0a%3c [[%3c%3c]]%0a%3c [[#FictionEnd]]%0a%3c %0a%3c [[#CurrentEvents]]%0a%3c (:table border=0:)%0a%3c (:cellnr bgcolor=#004a80 align=center:)%0a%3c '''%25white%25Current Events%25%25'''%0a%3c (:cellnr:)%0a%3c *...%0a%3c (:tableend:)%0a%3c [[%3c%3c]]%0a%3c [[#CurrentEventsEnd]]%0a%3c %0a%3c -----%0a%3c !!Characters%0a\ No newline at end of file%0a---%0a> [[#MtA-LocationEnd]]%0a> %0a> [[#MtA-History]]%0a> [[#MtA-History]]%0a\ No newline at end of file%0a

Fifty years ago a member of the Mysterium, whose name has been lost, almost destroyed the Athenaeum from within. In a fit of madness, or rage, the member incinerated volumes of work regarding the –Hattan- Project, supposedly destroyed at least one soul stone, and caused undisclosed amounts of other damage before they were either destroyed or driven off. The damage caused by this rogue mage affected the exterior of the building as well as the interior, not to mention the people who were inside at the time. Since then, the Athenaeum of Savannah has looked like a charred hulk, a derelict structure, a beautiful illusion.%0a%3c  %0a%3c The Mysterium of Savannah have a tradition going back to the first Hierophant, a Moros named -Soli-, to lead the order. Since the original, each Hierophant has donated a soulstone to the continued strength and growth of the Athenaeum. Because of this, the Athenaeum is not only the strongest Demense in Savannah, but in Georgia as there are no less than 8 soulstones, potentially as many at 10, in its circle of power.%0a%3c %0a%3c The building is three stories, and is only accessible through the area once intended for freight. There are existing wards, bans, and other spells that defend the property. Most of which are focused on keeping sleepers disinterested in some Urban Spelunking and Trespassing. One of the more ingenious spells, a thaumaturgy created by an Obrimos shortly after the building was wired for electricity, causes all the window panes, even those missing, to darken at night.. To most, the building is just an abandoned relic, never quite becoming an eye-sore, never falling apart enough to worry others.%0a%3c %0a%3c !!!Consilium Known:%0a%3c *The Mysterium does allow Consilium member to occasionally consult the Library of the Athenaeum. The Library is open to use for Spirit, natural History, Savannah History, Native American Practices, Geomancy, Ley Energy, Ghosts and Southern Cooking. Those Consilium members who have been inside the Athenaeum say that it feels much smaller inside than the building looks outside, a feeling that takes some getting used to.%0a%3c *There is a sizable scriptorium on the premises, but these facilities are only open to members of the Mysterium. %0a%3c *Rumor has it that there is a dueling area, one that has been used outside of the purview of the Sentinels, for what the Mysterium might occasionally refer to as “internal debates.” %0a%3c *There are monastery like cells for Mysterium members to use when they wish to stay at the Athenaeum, complete with a communal kitchen and small socializing area. %0a%3c *Other rumors suggest that there is also an area for experimentation, whether alchemical, arcane, or other experiments. One member of the Consilium spoke of seeing what they called “blast doors” when they were researching something in the athenaeum.%0a%3c %0a%3c [--%25color=#365776%25[[#top| Back to top]]--]%0a%3c %0a%3c [[#BT]]%0a%3c !!Beautiful Thieves%0a%3c ''[[Players.MageOrders|The Mysterium]]''\\%0a%3c %0a%3c %0a%3c %25rfloat text-align=center margin-top=5px margin-right=0px margin-bottom=5px margin-left=15px%25http://wantonwicked.gamingsandbox.com/wiki/images/mta/locations/beautifulthieves1.jpg%0a%3c Half art gallery, half pub, Beautiful Thieves a 3 story art bar located on W.

The Third floor, set up more like a salon than a home, is a meeting place of the Mysterium away from the Athenaeum. A casual space that is used, with and without –Aislin- being present; like the Athenaeum, there are some doors that do remained locked. Many have wonder why –Aislin- continued to live, or tend to this location, what with her going blind several years ago.

A medium security prison, the population is strictly male inmates. The Prison itself has a pristine history, actually breaking the mold of housing inmates without rehabilitation, with no incidents of wrong doing or riots. This would seem to be ideal, except that Coastal State is known to be under the auspices of the Seers of the Throne. At least one recognized and named Seer, -Thrush- is an associate warden. There is rumored to be an entire pylon working in the prison, or intermixed with the inmates. %0a%3c %0a%3c %25lfloat text-align=center margin-top=5px margin-right=15px margin-bottom=5px margin-left=0px width=150px%25http://wantonwicked.gamingsandbox.com/wiki/images/mta/npcs/thrush.jpg"-Thrush-"%0a%3c The Savannah Consilium has not poked at the potential hornets’ nest, playing a waiting game to find out the true purpose of the Seers. Attempts to use fate, time and other arcana to divine the purpose have been fruitless as the Seers have taken steps to protect their assets and investment in the facility. Due to –Thrush’s- high profile in the mundane sense, there has been no action against her directly.

The scent of well-worn leather, dry paper and old woods dominate the smell of the first floor. Here is the collection of heirlooms, of accumulated finery arranged in some inscrutable pattern. The owner of Charlatan always seems to be able to find the right gift, right where “she put it,” when customers come a calling. While her ability to find the perfect reassure hidden or stored among all the antiques seems as a surprise to her customers, to the Awakened of Savannah, well, the name of the business says it all. The owner of Charlatan is –Charity,- Mastigos of the Silver Ladder.%0a%3c  %0a%3c %25rfloat text-align=center margin-top=5px margin-right=0px margin-bottom=5px margin-left=15px width=150px%25http://wantonwicked.gamingsandbox.com/wiki/images/mta/npcs/charity.jpg"-Charity-"%0a%3c The set up for Charlatan is a simple, straight forward business arrangement. The 1st floor is the show room carrying everything from hand carved wooden furniture to antique firearms still in working order. Sets of silverware and real crystal chandeliers and mixed in with the occasional baseball card and an original acid etching of “Dark Side of the Moon.” The first floor is business, cluttered it would seem, but pristine, not a speck of dust, not one item out of place.%0a%3c %0a%3c %25lfloat text-align=center margin-top=5px margin-right=15px margin-bottom=5px margin-left=0px%25http://wantonwicked.gamingsandbox.com/wiki/images/mta/locations/charlatanantiquesandgifts2.jpg%0a%3c The basement, of course, is where the creepy curios are kept, because to do anything else would be foolish. The basement is part restoration area, part macabre keepsake display. The items, some of them, are for sale, others are not. Charlatan has been known, on the occasion, to traffic in arcane items; more than one Mysterium member has conducted business on the premises… for a fee of course.%0a%3c %0a%3c The top floor is living space and meeting space for the Silver Ladder.

The one time run down building was [[http://www.fda-online.com/project_detail.php?id=73|saved, renovated and updated]] in the early part of the 21st century.%0a%3c %0a%3c The Free Council doesn't “run” the entire building, in fact a majority of the building is used for the most mundane of purposes. The main theater has shown movies, held plays and operas, has been used for benefits, for student productions, has even seen the likes of Gallagher and other comedians. The main hall has been restored and is “quaint” with a seating of just over 1,400. But that is part of the Southern charm, the closeness, the need to know who is around you.%0a%3c %0a%3c While mortal work and productions do on, the Free Council holds sway in the “offices” of the theater. The building has 2 levels of basement, and then a sub-basement below that. These areas are off-limits to other awakened, and are only in use during theatrical productions. Even then, those who try and sneak around when the Libertines aren't looking learn the same lesson that Firmin and Andre learn in Paris; there are many secrets in the heart of a theater. %0a%3c %0a%3c %25rfloat text-align=center margin-top=5px margin-right=0px margin-bottom=5px margin-left=15px%25http://wantonwicked.gamingsandbox.com/wiki/images/mta/npcs/crier.jpg%0a%3c -Crier-, Enchantress of the Free Council, is a member of the board that operates the Lucas, she is also an administrator with SCAD, thus tying the two together.

There is also, if people believe this rumor, a rather large library of works and other pieces in the building, something akin to a vault of communal knowledge.%0a%3c %0a%3c [--%25color=#365776%25[[#top| Back to top]]--]%0a%3c [[%3c%3c]]%0a%3c %0a%3c [[#MP]]%0a%3c !!Morell Park%0a%3c ''[[Players.MageOrders|Adamantine Arrow]], [[Citybook.MageSettingConsilium|Consilium]]''%0a%3c %0a%3c %0a%3c As parks go Morell park is small, so small that the outdoor dog shows/races they have hear are limited to dachshunds. Located on the southern bank of the Savannah, the park is not much more than a green space attached to a parking lot for the Waving Girl and Hutchinson Island ferries. There are pieces of art, metal sculptures on display from SCAD, there is a simple walking path lined by trees and a good view of the Savannah River. Simple, nice, and as mundane as can be, the park fits in with the sedate atmosphere of Savannah. %0a%3c %0a%3c Of course, that is because there is no swimming in the Savannah, and the storm drains from the city are usually hidden beneath the pilings of the wharf for the ferries. Good thing they are mostly hidden, otherwise some enterprising soul might try and get into them. Back in the less than pristine history of Savannah, some of those drains were used to smuggle goods, including people, to and from the city. According to myth, least one of the drains will lead its way back to the Pirate’s House, though that has never been confirmed.%0a%3c %0a%3c This myth is true, though the way is a bit more convoluted with precautions against flooding. In the event of an emergency, the escape route is still there, waiting. It is rumored that at least one GoV escaped the pogrom against their order by using the old passages, passages that had not been used since Prohibition.%0a%3c %0a%3c Currently Morell Park is tended by the Adamantine Arrow.

The square has seen some fame, housing the first Royal Governor of Georgia at one point, but now is home to bed and breakfasts, parking lots, and other businesses. The businesses are not the important part of the square, the focus is on the park in the center.%0a%3c %0a%3c Near the center of the square, not to off from the Oglethorpe Square House, is a Sundial. The sundial faithful follows the shadow created by the sun, a shadow many sleeper has come to look at, well, to see at least once. What people don’t know is that the sundial , if looked at more intently, is accurate… down to the second, in regards to the placement of the sun. Somehow it auto-corrects, and even on a cloudy day people say that they can sometimes see a shadow representing the time.%0a%3c %0a%3c %25rfloat text-align=center margin-top=5px margin-right=0px margin-bottom=5px margin-left=15px%25http://wantonwicked.gamingsandbox.com/wiki/images/mta/locations/oglethorpesquare2.jpg%0a%3c To an awakened, there is something a little different going on. Looking at the sundial with certain magesights will give the Awakened a different picture than a normal sundial might provide. Instead of a shadow telling the time they see a shadow moving backwards, as if counting down. This shadow is not dependent on the sun, in fact, the shadow moves backwards no matter what time of day or night. There is only two problems… no one knows where the shadow began, or where it will end.%0a%3c %0a%3c %25lfloat text-align=center margin-top=5px margin-right=15px margin-bottom=5px margin-left=0px%25http://wantonwicked.gamingsandbox.com/wiki/images/mta/locations/oglethorpesquare3.jpg%0a%3c Because of this irregularity, -Siafu- has gained 24hr access to the nearby Oglethorpe Square House.

At least, that is what everyone is hoping.

There will be something more concrete in the future, but what the Consilium does is use a facility as a meeting place, rarely using the same place twice. Often appearing as an investment group, alumni, boosters or any of a number of organizations, the Consilium stays mobile instead of static. This form of mobile council was a result of the Pogrom against the GoV. The traditional Consilum meeting place of Wormsloe is still used, but sometimes a quick meeting has to happen in the city, and the public buildings SCAD are often times the most spacious and easiest to attain, defend and disappear from without anyone the wiser.%0a%3c %0a%3c [--%25color=#365776%25[[#top| Back to top]]--]%0a%3c %0a%3c [[#WP]]%0a%3c !!Wormsloe Plantation (Historic Site)%0a%3c [[CityBook.MageSettingConsilium|Consilium]]%0a%3c %0a%3c %0a%3c %25lfloat text-align=center margin-top=5px margin-right=15px margin-bottom=5px margin-left=0px%25http://wantonwicked.gamingsandbox.com/wiki/images/mta/locations/wormsloeplantation.jpg%0a%3c In 1736, Noble Jones obtained a grant for 500 acres (2.0 km2) of land on the Isle of Hope that would form the core of Wormsloe. He constructed a fortified house on the southeastern tip of the island overlooking the Skidaway Narrows, a strategic section of the Skidaway River located along the intracoastal waterway roughly halfway between downtown Savannah and the Atlantic Ocean. The fortified house was part of a network of defensive structures established by James Oglethorpe, founder of Georgia, and early Georgia colonists to protect Savannah from a potential Spanish invasion. Jones subsequently developed Wormsloe into a small plantation, and his descendants built a large mansion at the site which they used as a country residence.The State of Georgia acquired the bulk of the Wormsloe Plantation in 1973 and opened it to the public as a state historic site in 1979.%0a%3c %0a%3c !!!The Mansion%0a%3c %0a%3c %25rfloat text-align=center margin-top=5px margin-right=0px margin-bottom=5px margin-left=15px%25http://wantonwicked.gamingsandbox.com/wiki/images/mta/locations/wormsloeplantation2.jpg%0a%3c The Mansion is certainly spacious enough for Savannah’s Consilium, luckily the Consilium does not meet that often. When it does, the staff is reduced, and those who remain are sleepwalkers often tied with the various orders. The bar is often self-serve, and the kitchen is closed after providing finger foods and hors d’oeuvres, cleanup is simple as each member of the Consilium is expected to police themselves, Southern manners and all. The Consilium is careful about its presence in the Mansion; the building is old, a history hidden in the woods. The footsteps that have trod the halls are heavy, and they occasional feeling that ghosts, or spirits, watch the events at hand is not uncommon.%0a%3c %0a%3c !!!The Cemetery%0a%3c %0a%3c %25rfloat text-align=center margin-top=5px margin-right=0px margin-bottom=5px margin-left=15px%25http://wantonwicked.gamingsandbox.com/wiki/images/mta/locations/wormsloeplantation3.jpg %0a%3c More often used as a site for marriages and escapes, the Wormsloe Mansion is a relic of a South that predates the Civil War. Hidden away south of Savannah, the Wormsloe house is by the Consilium for an Occasional gathering, one that can host the various and numerous Awakened of the city. Not too far from the main house, nee mansion, is a private cemetery once used by the Jones family. This would not be of note, as many properties had private cemeteries back in the early colonial period, but the boundaries of the cemetery act as a Demense. It has been standing law that the area is left undisturbed in regards to the nature of the Demense, but it has been, at times, been used with the permission of the Hierarch, to practice, research, and experiment with arcana.%0a%3c %0a%3c !!!The Dueling House%0a%3c %0a%3c %25rfloat text-align=center margin-top=5px margin-right=0px margin-bottom=5px margin-left=15px%25http://wantonwicked.gamingsandbox.com/wiki/images/mta/locations/wormsloeplantation2.jpg %0a%3c Formal duels, accepted by multiple parties and with the permission of the Sentinels or the Consilium, have used this building on the former plantation’s main grounds for decades. The Dueling House, as it is known among the Awakened, was once a church on the Wormsloe Plantation. Even before its acquisition by the State of Georgia, this building had been the site of duels dating back to the early 20th century. The Consilium of Savannah, with the Plantation tenant’s unknowing permission and then with the state’s, has been using the former church for decades. First as a meeting place, and then as formal location for duels, the small building has seen the rise of the Savannah Consilium from the day its first stone was laid in a foundation.

The Pirate House now is a popular tourist attraction, a pub and restaurant where one can come and get a meal and a drink in good company and the safety of friends.%0a%3c %0a%3c It wasn’t always that way.%0a%3c %0a%3c %25lfloat text-align=center margin-top=5px margin-right=15px margin-bottom=5px margin-left=0px%25http://wantonwicked.gamingsandbox.com/wiki/images/mta/locations/thepirateshouse2.jpg%0a%3c Back in the day the Pirate’s House had a different commodity that spirits and foods that it was famous for. Besides beer, food and wenches, the “Pirate House” did a brisk trade in something else; they found new sailors for the ships. Rather than going to all the trouble of convincing people of what a nice life it was at sea (people knew better) they simply kidnapped them.%0a%3c %0a%3c This entry, you see, was the dumping point for men who had drank to much, been roofied by the owners of the bar, or just beaten over the head with a cudgel if they were stubborn enough to resist the loaded drinks. The good news, you could never say that the beer was watered down, the bad news, you could say that once you found yourself in the middle of an ocean. Once dumped into the tunnels, like this one, %0a%3c %0a%3c %0a%3c %25lfloat text-align=center margin-top=5px margin-right=15px margin-bottom=5px margin-left=0px%25http://wantonwicked.gamingsandbox.com/wiki/images/mta/locations/thepirateshouse5.jpg%0a%3c Connect the Pirate’s house to hidden exit points along the Savannah. Unbeknownst to most people walking the street of Savannah, one of those tunnels still exists, connecting The Pirate’s House to Morrell Park, less than a quarter of a mile apart, one of the Ferry landings on the southern bank of the Savannah River. This is unknown to the sleepers, not so much to the Awakened.%0a%3c %0a%3c The Pirate house still has some of those rooms open so that customers can see what life could have been like in the part, of course, the Consilium has a different use for those tunnels. One of the basement tunnels has a warded passage, a wall that is solid and innocuous to a sleeper as they suddenly remember it was time to go and have another drink, another cigarette, any normal and mundane reason not to tarry to long beneath the pub. To a sleepwalker, the tunnel itself is… interesting, but in the way that gives an itch to the back of the neck, and a desire to go and get some fresh air. For the Awakened, heading to the tunnel leads them to a dead end with a simple wrought Iron door that is locked. Speaking a simple incantation, an Atlantean word of power, opens the lock on the iron grate and allows the Awakened to travel a bit lower into the belly of Savannah.%0a%3c %0a%3c %25lfloat text-align=center margin-top=5px margin-right=15px margin-bottom=5px margin-left=0px%25http://wantonwicked.gamingsandbox.com/wiki/images/mta/locations/thepirateshouse3.jpg%0a%3c Many have researched the iron gate, and while its metallurgical composition is nothing shocking, the spells cast on the item are impressive. Starting with a mask of normality that is consistently on, when High speech is uttered around the gate there is a triggered Sense consciousness before the gate then opens. As the gate opens it casts a, for lack of a better term, eternal now on any sleepers within the area, in the tunnels or directly about them. At the same time there is a temporary incognito presence and imposter cast on any awakened entering the gate. The combination works that the sleepers don’t see anyone passing through, forgetting the person there a minute ago, perhaps passing them off as a ghost… the building is haunted you know.%0a%3c %0a%3c The combination of spells at the iron gate was placed by a master Mastigos in the early 1900’s, back when there was a revitalized interest in the darker histories of Savannah coincided with Prohibition. The basement of the Pirate’s House was first converted into a speak easy, the Awakened just assumed ownership of this portion of the building, making people forget about its existence. The basement has draught beer and a liquor shelf as stocked as the one above them in the main premises. Sadly, there is no kitchen in the basement, so the bar usually has pre-made sandwiches and bar nuts ( yes, the bar nuts are always stale.)%0a%3c %0a%3c %25lfloat text-align=center margin-top=5px margin-right=15px margin-bottom=5px margin-left=0px%25http://wantonwicked.gamingsandbox.com/wiki/images/mta/locations/thepirateshouse4.jpg%0a%3c %0a%3c Since its inception, the Awakened have always been involved with the Pirate’s House in one way or another. Sometimes as staff, other times as managers and owners, the Awakened presence around the building has seeped into the frame. There is an overall positive vibe about the building, a distraction for those still asleep that allows them to relax, to enjoy. It allows for the Awakened to continue about their business with some freedom, and occasionally get a good buzz while doing it.%0a%3c %0a%3c The Pirate’s house has changed hands between orders several times, sometimes used as a bartering chip, other times as a marker on a debt, the current owners of the Pirate House are the Silver Ladder. They manage the location with the understanding that all mages are welcome at the location.
