Her hair and eyes seem to glow internally with the distinct gold of the midday sun, a simple solid disk of the same color and luminescence seems affixed to her forehead over the 'third eye'.%0a49d47%0a%3c %0a51,53c49%0a%3c Sandy is a decent artist that had just moved from Omaha, Nebraska. She doesn't talk about her past much other then saying that she grew up in a rough neighborhood and that she had moved to Georgia to make a new start for herself. She moves like someone who's been a good number of fights and the numerous scars that pepper her forearms attest that they weren't all friendly fist fights.%0a%3c %0a%3c For all this one can tell that she's made a bit of progression with her painting, using it much like a meditative exercise. She is slightly known for doing commissions with painting for extra cash, specializing in model minis such as Warhammer, 40k, Warmachine, Malefaux, and Hordes.  %0a---%0a> ''Place your Public History Here''%0a55d50%0a%3c %0a59d53%0a%3c %0a
