Take your time and expect a sanction to last around a half hour. I will read your background, I will look up your merits, I will check the point expenditure and ask question about your concept of not only your mage, but how they fit in with other mages. I will offer contacts that make sense for you to know, I will deliver a background for your order if you have a character that should be in the know. I will offer hooks and contacts, open a few doors for you to get in gear and moving. This will be a collaborative effort, not just a yes, no, stamp of approval or denial and out the door moment. A thread ( at this point) will get started and I will flood the hell out of it with required venue information and a disclaimer that you will need to respond to before you get an Icon. It will be a busy time, I promise.%0a%0a%0aThis said, Contrary to popular belief, Storytellers are not out to get you and ruin your idea of the character you have created. Storytellers are not out to deny you, or change your sheet. There is no current list of "this is what we need in the venue" and conversely, there is no secret list “this is what we will not allow in the venue.” In fact, when people ask, "what type of character are you looking for?" The best response a storyteller can give is, "One you will be excited about playing that follows the sanctioning guidelines."Sometimes this means there will be some antagonistic characters in the venue. Good, not everyone gets along IRL, I will not expect everyone to get along here. As long as it is IC and not OOC I really have no issue with two characters going at each other with knives. Will there be sanctioned Seers or Bannisher characters? No, considering that those two books are restricted from player use that means you can’t make characters from them. But outside of that, I won’t ask you to play an angel, not even a fallen one. You do not always have to make nice with others, you can play in your style as long as you respect others playing in their style. Will this cause sparks, well, I certainly hope so, I would hate for anyone to get bored.%0a%0a%0aBut, this liberal sanctioning policy will, at times, make other players go "Why the hell did you sanction that." The answer, "The same reason I sanctioned you." As long as there is thought put into the character, that it is not designed to be antagonistic for antagonisms sake, then it has every right a fluffy muppet character has to be sanctioned. This does not mean I will just sanction any and everything that comes across the desk. In the end you can ask who has the right to decide if a concept will fit into the Venue? The storyteller sanctioning the character has this right, but more than this, they have a responsibility to the venue. While I appreciate a player’s effort and their comments, their justifications and reasoning for why their idea is a viable concept, there are certain concepts that the venue may not be able to handle or are counterproductive to role-play. Be prepared to discuss options in the event this happens. I understand I might lose some players by standing firm, but I will protect the venue, and that is the senior responsibility.%0a%0a[--%25color=#365776%25[[#top| Back to top]]--]%0a%0a%0a[[#CGG-2]]%0a!!General Considerations%0a%0aWhen creating a name, please remember naming conventions, that all character names must be human. Names like LordMasterThad Deathstalker are not going to get sanctioned.. Bloodbane as a shadow name? No problem. Some proof of the origins of a name may be required by the sanctioning ST. Your character also -needs- a shadow-name. When actually inputting your character, please follow site rules for text characters allowed. We are going to do something a little different however. Please only list your shadow name on the name area of your sheet. Use this format : ~shadowname~ and leave it at that. Now... your full name should begin your character background, and will also be used in the title of your experience thread. Remember, full names should not be public knowledge unless you are under the microscope in public.%0a%0aNormal Mortal rules and then the following are venue specific.%0a%0a'''1 Restrictive Slot'''%0a%0a• No more than one 4 (with justification) in Attributes. (a 4 dot counts as a restricted slot)%0a%0a• No more than one 4 dot Skill, no more than four 3 dots in Skills. And 3 dot skills with a specialty need justification. ( A four dot skill means you are a pro at what you do, it is hard to become a pro in multiple areas, that is why the 4 dot cap is in place. At hree dots Skill with a specialty is a restricted slot.)%0a%0a* Familiars, Spirit/ghost and mortal retainers count as 1 restrictive slot. Familiars:  If you are starting with a familiar you need to have a minimum of life 3 to justify a familiar being attached to you. Once this is done, be ready to discuss and "flesh" these puppies out. I have seen them misused far too many times, but they are still core to certain aspects of mage. Having a familiar is restricted without justification.%0a%0a* Wisdom drop for an additional 5 exp is a 1 restrictive slot. This can be done a maximum of 2 times.%0a%0a* Being a member of a Legacy is a restrictive slot.%0a%0a'''2 Restrictive Slots'''%0a%0a• Gnosis is capped at 3. (counts as two restricted slots.)%0a%0a* Dropping an Attribute to 1 dot is 2 restrictive slots.%0a%0a* Imbued / Enhanced items can be approved at creation at this time, however they need to have solid justification and explanation in the background. You will have to create them and define them as if you were reading about the items in a core book. Look to the imbued item write up for this site. There is a possibility that the item will not be approved. These items cost a minimum of 2 restrictive slots.%0a%0a'''Three Restrictive Slots'''%0a%0a• Arcana is capped at 3. ( NOTE: you can begin with dual disciple level primary arcana. Dual Disciple will count as 3 restrictive Slots. You cannot have an inferior arcana higher than a primary arcana at creation. You cap on inferior arcana is 2 per the book.))%0a%0a'''Misc'''%0a%0a• Order Status of 1 is free at character creation. (Order status does get you high speech for free.)%0a%0a• Consilium status is Capped at 1 and must be purchased.%0a%0a• If your back-story has you leaving one order and joining another you CANNOT have rotes that are order specific to the previous order. I.e: you only get from the order you are in and not the one you have left.%0a%0a'''Banned at creation'''%0a%0a• No Hallows are approved at creation%0a%0a• There are NO relics or artifacts approved at creation.%0a%0a* No merits from books not approved.%0a%0a* The following legacies are not allowed at this time at character creation:%0a%0aLegacies that are currently on the chopping block for one reason or another:%0a%0aBlank Badges%0a%0aDaoine%0a%0a%0aEleventh Question%0aFallen Pillar%0a%0aNeocologists%0a%0aSkalds%0a%0aSodality of Tor%0a%0aSphinx%0a%0aStone Scribes%0a%0aSubtle Ones%0a%0aTamers of Winds%0a%0aThe Morphean Continuity%0a%0aThrenodists%0a%0aWalkers in Mists%0a%0aWraiths of Epochs%0a%0aNo left Handed-Paths, or former practitioners of left handed paths will be allowed.%0a-H-%0a%0a[--%25color=#365776%25[[#top| Back to top]]--]%0a%0a%0a[[#CGG-3]]%0a!!Backgrounds%0a%0aThe Human history will not speak for itself, so make sure you include how you were prior to awakening, and how awakening affects you now. it does not need to be super long, doesn't need to be super tragic either, but it does need to be there..%0a%0aThe Awakening is an important part of a Mage character. In one series of events you are defining not only your current state of existence but your future outlook and concept. Path, Order, Goals, Beliefs, Nature, Demeanor... these and much more can all tie to your awakening. This is something you have to be able to describe and reflect when you create your mage. Now, I am not expecting a New York Best seller from everyone who plays mage. I understand there are different skill and comfort levels, regarding writing, with each player. Some people will write pages, others might produce an outline with bullet points. This being said.... Show interest and thought here. Show a pattern of reasoning and a solid grasp of a concept to work with%0a%0aThe Nimbus must also be developed and defined. As it is the effect magi (and sometimes sleepers) see when a) you let it show, b) when observed with Prime sight while you are casting magic and c) when you invoke Paradox. The Nimbus should reflect both your Awakening and your Path. If you are Obrimos and Awakened in a stormy dreamscape, your nimbus might include windblown hair and arching electrical discharges, for example.%0a%0aThe Background%0aI am not here to shoot down your style, your idea, concept or desire, but sometimes it happens. There will be times that we are just going to have to say,"No, that concept will not work in this venue." First off, it is nothing personal. We want to work with you and your concept, but some things we will not approve. Here is a short list of examples that I discourage:%0a%0a• Cross over Parents/Family/Loved Ones%0a• Mage since you were a child ---- parents may have been magically inclined but please work in that you did not know about their "kink" until later in life.%0a• Heavy Military involvement%0a• Extensive knowledge/involvement of other supers in the back story ( Ninja Warwuffs killed your parents and now you have a katana, an eye-patch and arcana as you seek revenge.) This game is focusing on mage, you do not have time to be a wolf/vampire/geist/smurf hunter.%0a%0aAs for the writing style, the key here is cover the core concepts. I have seen them all , two paragraph to 10 pages. Cover the points in your style, remember I am not asking for a New York Best Seller ( and if you can crank that out why the heck are you here?) but if you can do it cool. If not, Bullet point outlines with certain areas fleshed out in greater detail work as well. Just remember, your back story is your evidence and justification for how you spend your dots, a thin back story leave you little room to maneuver.%0a%0aRemaking Characters%0aThe remaking of a Mage when there was a previous character on this chat, or another, is not allowed. Also, characters who are similar in creation, background, stats and contacts can be denied an icon at the discretion of the sanctioning story teller. An exception might be made for a character who was a mortal or sleepwalker on another chat as long as there are enough differences between that character and this one. Continuous histories will not be allowed.%0a%0a[--%25color=#365776%25[[#top| Back to top]]--]%0a%0a%0a[[#CGG-4]]%0a!!Re-Sanctioning%0a%0aSanctioning can be a lengthy process. Anything worthwhile has attention paid to it, and sanctioning will be no different. On occasion players will want to change their characters because the need or want to play that concept changes. For whatever reason the old concept has grown stale, unplayable, or a myriad of other scenarios that makes the player start toying with a new concept. While I have no issues with people changing characters, I will set some grounds rules for dropping and recreating a character:%0a%0a1) At no time will I allow a player to stop playing their current character to escape in game repercussions for their actions. If a chain of events has begun, and it is because of a set of actions that a character has set in motion, they need to be seen through until the end. Anyone trying to dodge this by remaking, or having their character pull a Kizer Sose, will get a rest from the venue to be determined by me.%0a%0a%0a2) We will not allow the new character to be the mirror image/carbon copy of the previous character. If you got tired of, could not play, the previous character why are you remaking it? Also, there is a no remake policy in effect for this venue.%0a%0a%0a3) You cannot know your next incarnation. You are de-sanctioning your character and all ties need to be severed as such. If you have built an in-character relationship of mentor and student. lovers, mage and sleepwalker, et al. when you come in with your new character you are fresh off the boat. The bond between a mentor and student, or a sleepwalker and awakened, is supposed to be one of trust and secrecy. You cannot really expect for someone to just blindly trust a change like that. Now, I cannot stop you from role-playing the immediate bond with a new person. Let's just say I will be disappointed in both players for doing this and really, that is all i can be, disappointed.%0a%0a%0a4) If your character was a member of a cabal then the new character being spawned should not come in knowing everything about the cabal. Mages are, by definition, a secretive lot. If a member of a cabal had a sibling or friend that they told everything to, I think this would make the rest of mages in the cabal suspicious and not so sure that their secrets were actually secrets. How could they trust the new member considering the old one told everything about them. Coming in with prior knowledge /should/ bite you in the ass.%0a%0a* Note: Notice the use of the word "should" in number four. No, we cannot enforce this but I am pointing it out.%0a%0aIf there are people who are de-sanctioning and creating new characters, it is my hope that one of the questions I ask will be: " Are all your affairs in order, is there anything outstanding that needs to be taken care of." Your honesty here is appreciated. %0a[--%25color=#365776%25[[#top| Back to top]]--]%0a%0a%0a[[#CGG-5]]%0a!!Misc%0a%0aLastly. Sometimes characters never fit, you can't get into them. I understand that, we all do. However, if you are remaking a character once every month, or every few months, and you are never taking them IC, yet still you want to make a new character, then there is another problem here. We reserve the right to not allow players to cycle through concepts. I reserve the right to give you time off to focus on a concept that you can enjoy and play. This is not me trying to be heavy handed, I do have concepts that are meant to try and make the mage game better. If you are simply dodging consequences or you are holding the foyer down and occasionally just want a new name, then you will be asked to take some time off from the venue. The game is not a revolving door for people to cycle through character concepts, keep this in mind.%0a[--%25color=#365776%25[[#top| Back to top]]--]%0a

For whatever reason the old concept has grown stale, unplayable, or a myriad of other scenarios that makes the player start toying with a new concept. While I have no issues with people changing characters, I will set some grounds rules for dropping and recreating a character:%0a%3c %0a%3c 1) At no time will I allow a player to stop playing their current character to escape in game repercussions for their actions. If a chain of events has begun, and it is because of a set of actions that a character has set in motion, they need to be seen through until the end. Anyone trying to dodge this by remaking, or having their character pull a Kizer Sose, will get a rest from the venue to be determined by me.%0a%3c %0a%3c %0a%3c 2) We will not allow the new character to be the mirror image/carbon copy of the previous character. If you got tired of, could not play, the previous character why are you remaking it? Also, there is a no remake policy in effect for this venue.%0a%3c %0a%3c %0a%3c 3) You cannot know your next incarnation. You are de-sanctioning your character and all ties need to be severed as such. If you have built an in-character relationship of mentor and student. lovers, mage and sleepwalker, et al. when you come in with your new character you are fresh off the boat. The bond between a mentor and student, or a sleepwalker and awakened, is supposed to be one of trust and secrecy. You cannot really expect for someone to just blindly trust a change like that. Now, I cannot stop you from role-playing the immediate bond with a new person. Let's just say I will be disappointed in both players for doing this and really, that is all i can be, disappointed.%0a%3c %0a%3c %0a%3c 4) If your character was a member of a cabal then the new character being spawned should not come in knowing everything about the cabal. Mages are, by definition, a secretive lot. If a member of a cabal had a sibling or friend that they told everything to, I think this would make the rest of mages in the cabal suspicious and not so sure that their secrets were actually secrets. How could they trust the new member considering the old one told everything about them. Coming in with prior knowledge /should/ bite you in the ass.%0a%3c %0a%3c * Note: Notice the use of the word "should" in number four. No, we cannot enforce this but I am pointing it out.%0a%3c %0a%3c If there are people who are de-sanctioning and creating new characters, it is my hope that one of the questions I ask will be: " Are all your affairs in order, is there anything outstanding that needs to be taken care of." Your honesty here is appreciated. %0a%3c [--%25color=#365776%25[[#top| Back to top]]--]%0a%3c %0a%3c %0a%3c [[#CGG-5]]%0a%3c !!Misc%0a%3c %0a%3c Lastly. Sometimes characters never fit, you can't get into them. I understand that, we all do. However, if you are remaking a character once every month, or every few months, and you are never taking them IC, yet still you want to make a new character, then there is another problem here. We reserve the right to not allow players to cycle through concepts. I reserve the right to give you time off to focus on a concept that you can enjoy and play. This is not me trying to be heavy handed, I do have concepts that are meant to try and make the mage game better. If you are simply dodging consequences or you are holding the foyer down and occasionally just want a new name, then you will be asked to take some time off from the venue. The game is not a revolving door for people to cycle through character concepts, keep this in mind.%0a%3c [--%25color=#365776%25[[#top| Back to top]]--]%0a
