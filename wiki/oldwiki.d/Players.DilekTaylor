Her long auburn hair cascades down her shoulders, framing her perfect features, cheekbones and nose as if carved by  a master sculptor, her stunning hazel eyes seeming to pierce your soul with their intensity.%0a%3c %0a%3c '''The Lineage''' \\%0a%3c The Taylor family is associated with so much of Savannah’s culture, that it’s particularly easier to say what they aren’t involved with.Originally a small family owned construction business, known for their excellent restorations and handiwork, the Taylor family has founded Marquee Savannah within the local entertainment sector. From cigar bars to Blues Joints, The Taylor’s own 4 of Savannah’s hottest clubs, an art gallery, and the Fall of 2013 announces the opening of their new restaurant “Marquee”. %0a%3c [[%3c%3c]]%0a%3c %0a%3c %25lfloat text-align=center margin-top=5px margin-right=15px margin-bottom=5px margin-left=0px width=175 newwin%25http://amourdelavie.net/Mortal/down1.png%0a%3c http://amourdelavie.net/Mortal/history5.png%0a%3c Dilek was brought up strict and with a platinum spoon in her mouth.  She was the apple of her parents’ eyes, excelling in school while winning beauty pageants.  Her popularity and success continued through high school, where she was the captain of the cheerleading squad and Prom Queen.  While she dated, she was more concerned about maintaining her family image so became known as a good girl, although she preferred to think of herself as a lady.  %0a%3c Instead of going away to an ivy league school Dilek decided to go to Whitefield University majoring in business. She spent four years keeping her nose in the books, for the most part. Finding the curriculum more challenging than high school, and professors tougher to charm.  The social scene at school found an avid participant in Dilek, particularly the events that ‘mattered.’  She got a reputation as a bit of a cold fish due to this but no one at least would ever accuse the Taylor heir of being a slut. %0a%3c After graduation, she worked for a local real estate agent named Denny Hobs. While he was solid, he was limited, and Dilek leveraged him as much as possible before moving on to bigger and better things.  She has started her own real estate company, using what she learned from Denny and her familial connections to quickly become one of the most influential real estate agents in the city.%0a%3c %0a%3c [[%3c%3c]]%0a%3c %25rfloat text-align=center margin-top=5px margin-right=15px margin-bottom=5px margin-left=0px width=150 newwin%25http://amourdelavie.net/Mortal/Down2.jpg %0a%3c http://amourdelavie.net/Mortal/rphooks5.png%0a%3c %25width=25%25http://wantonwicked.gamingsandbox.com/wiki/images/wod/smallsymbols/wod_s.png '''%25newwin%25[- Hanging around'''-][-(High Society):-][- Perhaps you've seen her at her regular table at Noble Fare.
