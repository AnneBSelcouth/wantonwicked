She knows she’s somebody and it permeates the whole of her existence.  This was no mere woman; this was a lioness on the prowl in her own jungle.  The Daeva wears both of her heritages well; her pale eyes shift from green or blue depending on the lighting set off by café au lait brown skin. Dark blonde, kinky curls are frequently allowed to fall into a wild, curly mane with notably sullen looks coming whenever there’s the suggestion she relax her hair to be more “professional” in appearance.%0a[[%3c%3c]]%0a%0a%25lfloat text-align=center margin-top=5px margin-right=15px margin-bottom=5px margin-left=0px width=350 newwin%25http://i77.photobucket.com/albums/j52/Kitsuiko/Michael02_zps49a15a76.jpg%0a%25width=300%25http://i77.photobucket.com/albums/j52/Kitsuiko/WanWic%2520Character%2520Pictures/cooltext1231989723_zps9a54975f.png%0a%25color=#999999%25Michael was born a daughter of the Sons.  Her father Trevon Bertram had graduated from the hustle long before she was born.  He moved his lady and his son up to a three bedroom house in a decent part of Kensington.  He dressed well; going to the barber shop every Friday and his tailor every month to make sure he looked good every Sunday -- but there was no question about his loyalties: He was a Son of Piru like his father and his uncles were before him.  There was only one difference; Trevon had vision.  There was a world bigger for the Sons and he meant to see it.  A world where his kids wouldn’t have to hustle like he did, one where the Bloods could get out of the low game-shit and get into the big money.  %0a%0a%25color=#999999%25His oldest son, Elijah, saw things differently.  He saw an old man getting soft on comforts and trying to put on an act to be somebody he wasn’t.  They fought, day and night, when Trevon tried to get his son to go to school and learn something.  When he tried to encourage him to have a bigger plan than dealing on the streets.  Things came to a head when Elijah's mom, Delanie Young, relapsed on drugs. Elijah broke from the family completely after Delanie was killed from a bad batch of cocaine and he gunned down her dealer in the street, going away to juvie until he turned 18. %0a%0a%25color=#999999%25Michael – named after the angel – was quite different.  She went to a good private school and did her homework every night just like Trevon said; she ate up every word about taking power how they could and changing the nature of the hustle.  That vision of the streets – their streets.  Sure, her being on little league was mostly so Trevon could get to know this one guy in shipping and her school friends were picked out for their parents connections, but she understood the game.  She grew up pretty and she grew up smart.  Trevon made sure his daughter kept her roots Blood red, even giving one of his soldiers his blessing to start seeing his baby girl and when she was old enough to take her beating and bleed for them, she bled.    %0a%0a%25color=#999999%25Life became a cultivation of two faces; the Michael who was the Alpha Kappa Alpha, the black-belle who went to church every Sunday and the Michael who brought coke to slip into hands and took all the right cell-phone pictures for later. just in case.  By the time she graduated she did so with a black book full of names that owed her little favors here and there throughout Savannah and when she returned home it didn’t take long to turn that degree into the New Horizons Community Center as the chief assistant to the board of directors.%0a[[%3c%3c]]%0a%0a%25width=650%25http://i77.photobucket.com/albums/j52/Kitsuiko/WanWic%2520Character%2520Pictures/cooltext1231989912_zps92a10edc.png%0a%25lfloat text-align=center margin-top=5px margin-right=15px margin-bottom=5px margin-left=0px width=350 newwin%25http://i77.photobucket.com/albums/j52/Kitsuiko/Michael03_zpsd2520a7c.jpg%0a%0a%25color=#999999%25'''[[CityBook.NewPathCommunityCenter|New Path Community Center]]''' - (Anyone) New Path Community Center is a non-profit organization situated the Central Distrct.  While a relatively new agency, New Path has had relative good press from a few small projects; most notably being the successful venture of building a new playground in South Garden.  That said, due to its neighborhood location it is mostly a pleasant, if unremarkable, cultural entity.  New Path is primarily focused on being a youth center and a cultural organization though it does offer some job training and placement assistance; due to the relative affluence of the neighborhood it mostly offers volunteer work to help other areas by way of community service with the elderly, going downtown to help clean up streets, and charity drives.  %0a%0a%25color=#999999%25'''Sons of Piru''' - (Criminals; Bloods) For those who are already members of the Sons of Piru or who know what to look for, there are subtle signs of Michael’s allegiances though what little public image she has and needs to maintain is kept clean.  Trevon’s old enough to consider retiring from the game and it’s clear both of his children want his crown.  The question is which one is going to want it a little more.  To call Michael “protective” over the Sons of Piru might be an understatement – she is as loyal to the gang as most are to their religion.  Most challenges to the Sons will draw her out sooner or later.%0a%0a%25color=#999999%25'''The Hook Up''' - (Vampire; Carthians) There’s little question that Michael is connected but how deep the rabbit hole goes might surprise most people.  Her former friends, ex-boyfriends, sorority sisters, play-uncles… the list goes on and on and they’re scattered all throughout the city – lawyers, criminals, police, and business men.  She can find you money, legal protection, drugs… almost anything just given some time.  Thankfully, Michael’s usually willing to make a deal.  %0a%0a%25rfloat text-align=center margin-top=5px margin-right=15px margin-bottom=5px margin-left=0px width=350 newwin%25http://i77.photobucket.com/albums/j52/Kitsuiko/Michael04_zps59505fff.jpg%0a%25color=#999999%25'''Blood In; Blood Out''' - (Vampire) – Despite the circumstances of her joining being particularly bombastic and her relationship with her Sire being decidedly atypical, Michael made a splash in the Carthian movement almost immediately with her powerful rhetoric and her incisive arguments.  Her skill at finding just the right thing in Carthian Law has been noted with equal amounts of frustration and amusement.  Still, she waffles for which side of things she favors – the status quo or the new way.  Both seem to catch her eye.%0a %0a%25color=#999999%25'''Wayward Childe''' - (Vampire) It remains a question what caused Michael to go Carthian way.  Some suggest that she heard that the Invictus were running with the Crips and she couldn't let mortal problems remain mortal problems.  Others tell that it was a spat between Sire and Childe and this was a little bit of teenaged insubordination that would work itself out in a decade or so.  Still others believe that the Succubus was lured by Chris Sloane’s rhetoric and charm and remains still hot for teacher.  Whatever the truth of the matter, the outcome was clear – Michael and Millicent spoke behind closed doors and returned from them to sit with the Carthians.  While polite to each other publicly, more than a few wonder precisely what was said.%0a%0a[[%3c%3c]]%0a%25width=350%25http://i77.photobucket.com/albums/j52/Kitsuiko/WanWic%2520Character%2520Pictures/cooltext1231990207_zps138ff9d6.png%0a%0a%25lfloat width=90%25http://i77.photobucket.com/albums/j52/Kitsuiko/Millicent_zpsdcbd6b62.jpg%0a'%25color=#999999%25 [[Players.MillicentStClaire|Millicent St Claire]] -''' Sire'''; ''While certainly the two were on surprisingly good terms considering Michael's defection; in recent nights the youngest child of the Dame Judex seems to have grown even closer yet.

She knows she’s somebody and it permeates the whole of her existence.  This was no mere woman; this was a lioness on the prowl in her own jungle.  The Daeva wears both of her heritages well; her pale eyes shift from green or blue depending on the lighting set off by café au lait brown skin. Dark blonde, kinky curls are frequently allowed to fall into a wild, curly mane with notably sullen looks coming whenever there’s the suggestion she relax her hair to be more “professional” in appearance.%0a%3c [[%3c%3c]]%0a%3c %0a%3c %25lfloat text-align=center margin-top=5px margin-right=15px margin-bottom=5px margin-left=0px width=350 newwin%25http://i77.photobucket.com/albums/j52/Kitsuiko/WanWic%2520Character%2520Pictures/jasmine-sanders-6_zps67a98f1a.jpg%0a%3c %25width=300%25http://i77.photobucket.com/albums/j52/Kitsuiko/WanWic%2520Character%2520Pictures/cooltext1231989723_zps9a54975f.png%0a%3c %25color=#999999%25Michael was born a daughter of the Sons.  Her father Trevon Bertram had graduated from the hustle long before she was born.  He moved his lady and his son up to a three bedroom house in a decent part of Kensington.  He dressed well; going to the barber shop every Friday and his tailor every month to make sure he looked good every Sunday -- but there was no question about his loyalties: He was a Son of Piru like his father and his uncles were before him.  There was only one difference; Trevon had vision.  There was a world bigger for the Sons and he meant to see it.  A world where his kids wouldn’t have to hustle like he did, one where the Bloods could get out of the low game-shit and get into the big money.  %0a%3c %0a%3c %25color=#999999%25His oldest son, Elijah, saw things differently.  He saw an old man getting soft on comforts and trying to put on an act to be somebody he wasn’t.  They fought, day and night, when Trevon tried to get his son to go to school and learn something.  When he tried to encourage him to have a bigger plan than dealing on the streets.  Things came to a head when Elijah's mom, Delanie Young, relapsed on drugs. Elijah broke from the family completely after Delanie was killed from a bad batch of cocaine and he gunned down her dealer in the street, going away to juvie until he turned 18. %0a%3c %0a%3c %25color=#999999%25Michael – named after the angel – was quite different.  She went to a good private school and did her homework every night just like Trevon said; she ate up every word about taking power how they could and changing the nature of the hustle.  That vision of the streets – their streets.  Sure, her being on little league was mostly so Trevon could get to know this one guy in shipping and her school friends were picked out for their parents connections, but she understood the game.  She grew up pretty and she grew up smart.  Trevon made sure his daughter kept her roots Blood red, even giving one of his soldiers his blessing to start seeing his baby girl and when she was old enough to take her beating and bleed for them, she bled.    %0a%3c %0a%3c %25color=#999999%25Life became a cultivation of two faces; the Michael who was the Alpha Kappa Alpha, the black-belle who went to church every Sunday and the Michael who brought coke to slip into hands and took all the right cell-phone pictures for later. just in case.  By the time she graduated she did so with a black book full of names that owed her little favors here and there throughout Savannah and when she returned home it didn’t take long to turn that degree into the New Horizons Community Center as the chief assistant to the board of directors.%0a%3c [[%3c%3c]]%0a%3c %0a%3c %25width=650%25http://i77.photobucket.com/albums/j52/Kitsuiko/WanWic%2520Character%2520Pictures/cooltext1231989912_zps92a10edc.png%0a%3c %25lfloat text-align=center margin-top=5px margin-right=15px margin-bottom=5px margin-left=0px width=350 newwin%25http://i77.photobucket.com/albums/j52/Kitsuiko/WanWic%2520Character%2520Pictures/tumblr_mlbars34J01rfhsy0o1_1280_zpsf4cd2981.jpg%0a%3c %0a%3c %25color=#999999%25 * '''New Horizons Community Center''' - (Anyone) New Horizons Community Center is a non-profit organization situated the Central Distrct.  While a relatively new agency, New Horizons has had relative good press from a few small projects; most notably being the successful venture of building a new playground in South Garden.  That said, due to its neighborhood location it is mostly a pleasant, if unremarkable, cultural entity.  New Horizons is primarily focused on being a youth center and a cultural organization though it does offer some job training and placement assistance; due to the relative affluence of the neighborhood it mostly offers volunteer work to help other areas by way of community service with the elderly, going downtown to help clean up streets, and charity drives.  %0a%3c %0a%3c %25color=#999999%25 * '''Sons of Piru''' - (Anyone) For those who are already members of the Sons of Piru or who know what to look for, there are subtle signs of Michael’s allegiances.  Trevon’s old enough to consider retiring from the game and it’s clear both of his children want his crown.  The question is which one is going to want it a little more.  To call Michael “protective” over the Sons of Piru might be an understatement – she is as loyal to the gang as most are to their religion.  Most challenges to the Sons will draw her out sooner or later.%0a%3c %0a%3c %25color=#999999%25 * '''The Hook Up''' - (Vampire; Carthians) There’s little question that Michael is connected but how deep the rabbit hole goes might surprise most people.  Her former friends, ex-boyfriends, sorority sisters, play-uncles… the list goes on and on and they’re scattered all throughout the city – lawyers, criminals, police, and business men.  She can find you money, legal protection, drugs… almost anything just given some time.  Thankfully, Michael’s usually willing to make a deal.  %0a%3c %0a%3c %25rfloat text-align=center margin-top=5px margin-right=15px margin-bottom=5px margin-left=0px width=350 newwin%25http://i77.photobucket.com/albums/j52/Kitsuiko/WanWic%2520Character%2520Pictures/roosje_zpsc7097080.jpg%0a%3c %25color=#999999%25 * '''Blood In; Blood Out''' - (Vampire) – Despite the circumstances of her joining being particularly bombastic and her relationship with her Sire being decidedly atypical, Michael made a splash in the Carthian movement almost immediately with her powerful rhetoric and her incisive arguments.  Her skill at finding just the right thing in Carthian Law has been noted with equal amounts of frustration and amusement.  Still, she waffles for which side of things she favors – the status quo or the new way.  Both seem to catch her eye.%0a%3c  %0a%3c %25color=#999999%25 * '''Wayward Childe''' - (Vampire) It remains a question what caused Michael to go Carthian way.  Some suggest that she heard that the Invictus were running with the Crips and she couldn't let mortal problems remain mortal problems.  Others tell that it was a spat between Sire and Childe and this was a little bit of teenaged insubordination that would work itself out in a decade or so.  Still others believe that the Succubus was lured by Chris Sloane’s rhetoric and charm and remains still hot for teacher.  Whatever the truth of the matter, the outcome was clear – Michael and Millicent spoke behind closed doors and returned from them to sit with the Carthians.  While polite to each other publicly, more than a few wonder precisely what was said.%0a%3c %0a%3c [[%3c%3c]]%0a%3c %25width=350%25http://i77.photobucket.com/albums/j52/Kitsuiko/WanWic%2520Character%2520Pictures/cooltext1231990207_zps138ff9d6.png%0a%3c '%25color=#999999%25 * [[Millicent St Claire]] -''' Sire'''; ''Despite having left to join the Carthian Movement Michael never has anything negative to say about the woman and is always a little more formal leading many to question what really happened behind closed doors. Strangely, the part seems to be amiable?  Accepted? Or maybe it’s just the blood.
