She comes from a long tradition of law enforcement officers and it wasn't a question on if she was joining, it was only a question of when and where she'd go in the department.  %0a%3c %0a%3c Delta has had a pretty amazing career thus far.  Before she even applied to the academy she went to North Carolina to the now extinct Blackwater training compound where she got a leg up on everything she needed to breeze through the academy and graduate top of her class.  Once she finished her patrol requirements she went immediately to the K9 Unit and from there moved onto the SWAT team as their K9 handler.%0a%3c %0a%3c [[%3c%3c]]%0a%3c %25%25http://wantonwicked.gamingsandbox.com/wiki/images/wtf/headers/wtf_rph.png%0a%3c "What do you mean I was speeding officer?"  - Have you been on the wrong side of the law?
