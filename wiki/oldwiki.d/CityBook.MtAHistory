Modern Savannah is built on the lands once held by the Guale Indians. With the Timucua to the South and the Creek Indians to the West, the Gaule held a fertile section of what would eventually become Georgia. Their Lands extended north to the future border of South Carolina and their Eastern extent was the Atlantic Ocean. The Guale had seen the incursion of the French, and of the Spanish, and though their Awakened numbers were small, they were organized under the Leadership of the Guale Shaman known only as ''Hattan''.  ''Hattan'', both a shaman for his people and a Thyrsus, had tilled and worked the land with his own hands, he was a supposed master of the Life and Spirit arcanas, and if the rumors were true, was also a master of prime as well. The lands of the Guale were lush, and were coveted by the Yamasee and Creek tribes. Because of this, the Guale were constantly in a defensive state, not looking to expand their boarders as much as seeking to protect what they already had.%0a> %0a> It was 1563 and an expedition  led by Jean Ribault, a French naval officer, brought ''Hattan'' in contact with a member of the Awakened from Europe.  Among Ribault’s party was a mage known as ''Gideon''.  ''Gideon'' had joined Ribault’s party as a spiritual advisor, though his other mission was a bit more serious. ''Gideon'' was an advance scout sent by the Paris Consilium meant to make contact with the Awakened in the New World.  Most of ''Gideon’s'' accounts were of modern day South Carolina, but as Ribault moved farther south ''Gideon'' would encounter  ''Hattan'' and the Gaule. Luckily ''Gideon'' was wise enough to come as a supplicant and not a conqueror, and an uneasy friendship was struck up. ''Hattan'' learned of the organization and the size of the European Awakened, and ''Gideon'' learned of something far greater. ''Hattan'' had been shaping the land and the ley lines in a project that had taken most of his life. Slow cultivation of the powerful nodes of Awakened Magic, it was ''Hattan’s'' Mission to create a self-sustaining network of nodes that would nourish the land, and the people in turn.%0a> %0a> ''Gideon'' was wise enough to display awe instead of a more covetous nature. ''Gideon'' knew he had to report of this experiment to the Paris Consilium, but had no means to do so until Ribault pushed on. Acting as counsel to Ribault, he convinced the French explorer to push farther South and into the lands of the Spaniards in the hopes of contacting more of the Awakened from the old world. With feigned reluctance, ''Gideon'' took his leave of ''Hattan'', a new mission assigned by himself, now of paramount importance.  ''Hattan'', who was cautious, did not know of ''Gideon’s'' f thoughts, and had little choice in what he must do. ''Hattan'' began redoubled his efforts on his project, his goal to see his people prosper and be protected the forefront thought in his mind.%0a> %0a> ''Gideon'' would continue to travel with Ribault until Ribault and many of his party were ambushed and killed near the Spanish Settlement of St. Augustine. ''Gideon'' was taken “prisoner” by an Awakened member of the Spaniard contingent, an Adamantine Arrow known as ''Falchion''.  ''Falchion'' arranged for ''Gideon’s'' ransom under the guise of ''Gideon'' being a Roman Catholic priest. _''Gideon'' was careful not to mention ''Hattan'' or his project, keeping that information for his superiors. ''Gideon'' feared that the Spanish Awakened would act before he could report his findings to his colleagues in Paris, and so ''Gideon'' waited, suffering the trip across the Atlantic with a barely contained excitement. ''Hattan’s'' work, in this wild and untamed land, was something not seen in Europe, a place where boundaries and cities had been established for centuries.%0a> %0a> %0a> [%25color=#365776%25[[#top| Back to top]]]%0a> %0a> %0a> [[#PT2]]%0a> !!Change%0a> %0a> ''Gideon'' did survive his travel back to the Paris Consilium, but the greeting he expected from his order, and the Consilium, was less than he had hoped for. Seers had pushed against the Paris Consilium, and there was an open war fought with rapier and main gauche, covert spells and assassinations, that filled the streets of Paris. ''Gideon’s'' news of a fantastic experiment in the New World was not worthy enough of his order’s full attention, there was a price in blood that was the forefront thought of the Consilium, and the Consilium had been martialed for war. ''Gideon'', knowing that the war was likely to be a long one, looked for other options. In a series of political moves, ''Gideon'' was assigned as an ambassador of his order to other cities and other Consili. For the next 10 years ''Gideon'' travelled throughout France, looking for a Consilium to fund a voyage back to the New World. He was met with political infighting and skepticism. The Old World had seen, had done, it all. How had such a wild land been able to produce greater works than the Masters of Europe? ''Gideon'' was not a man of prophecy, his knowledge of fate and time was a hindrance, but he had his own vision of ''Hattan’s'' project, one that was for the benefit of the European Awakened as they made it to the New World. It was in desperation that ''Gideon'' made what some might consider a deal with a Devil. It was 1575 when ''Gideon'' left France and made his way to England, specifically, the Consilium of London.%0a> %0a> The English were much more receptive to the information that ''Gideon''  Provided. There were no English settlements in the New World at this time, and ''Gideon’s'' tales of the new World Sparked an excitement within the Consilium of London. ''Gideon'' would spend the rest of his time in England, knowing that he would be considered a pariah in his home country and the Paris Consilium. Through a network of contacts, ''Gideon'' learned that the Paris Consilium was bled close to dry in the war with the Seers, a war that lasted two years. This was one of the last things ''Gideon'' would learn, he succumbed to the outbreak of Typhus in the city of Oxford in 1577. His work, however, spurred the Awakened to push the English colonization of the New World. In 1578 Walter Raleigh would lead the first expedition to the New World, only to be turned back. It would not be until 1607 that the English would finally make a foothold in North America with the settlement of Jamestown ion 1607.%0a> ''Hattan'' had not been idle during this time, though he had become a recluse in many ways. His project took all of his time, the crafting of land pushed his knowledge of the Supernal and of the mundane world to new heights. In the time ''Gideon'' had been gone ''Hattan'' and reshaped and moved nodes, healed and created new ley lines, altered the geography of the land, and worked incessantly on his wonder. His focus was drifting away from the fallen world and was taking him on a path to greater understanding of the supernal. He became a living myth to his people, the shaman of the shamans. There was even talk of him becoming a living ancestor, an avatar of the spirits of the Gaule.%0a> %0a> While ''Hattan'' delved deeper into the supernal his people fought to survive. Never warlike, the Gaule were hard pressed to survive with the  warlike Creek as their neighbor. First influenced by the French, the Spanish soon took an interest in the Guele and tried desperately to incorporate them into their Mission System of colonization. At first the Guale  seemed to acclimate to the Spanish, but the Guale were too far away from the powerbase the Spanish had in St. Augustine. As a mission province, the Guale were unstable, and in 1597 there was a revolt against the system. Part of the Guale ability to survive was the continued relationship with the French, one kept in secret, which allowed them to avoid the full incorporation into the Spanish System.%0a> %0a> For a while there was an uneasy balance of power, the Guale continued to survive, but each year saw them holding on with less of a grip to their ancestral lands. The English colonization of the mid-Atlantic was comparatively quick. After the settlement of Jamestown in Virginia the English quickly asserted themselves up and down the Atlantic seaboard. In 1670 the English founded their southernmost settlement with Charleston. By 1675 Indian tribes supported by the British were attacking and destroying missions created by the Spanish. Because this was done by Native Americans the Spanish were unable to hold the English accountable. For most this seemed simple nationalistic combat, countries fighting over new resources. While the Spanish have no record of Awakened involvement, the London Consilium knows full and well that the Awakened pushed many of these combats. They were fueled with the knowledge left behind by ''Gideon'', and their own resources with fate told of a great wonder being created in the lands of the Guale.%0a> %0a> Though it is not talked about, it is said that an order of Awakened introduced various diseases into the area to force the Guale into capitulation. Small Pox, Typhus, and other diseases ravaged the natives, forcing them to create amalgamation of tribes that would be called the Yamasee.  For several years this group would try to exist despite disease and intertribal warfare.  After the Yamasee wars in South Carolina, and with the British Invasion of Florida in 1702, the Yamasee, nee Guale, were virtually extinct. Of ''Hattan'' and his work there was no word, ''Hattan'' had vanished sometime in the 1600’s and had not been heard of save for the myths and the legends of his people. There was no news of his wonder, or his work. The British were ready to create a settlement, and in 30 years, Savannah would be born.%0a> %0a> %0a> [%25color=#365776%25[[#top| Back to top]]]%0a> %0a> [[#PT3]]%0a> !!Savannah%0a> %0a> ''Hattan'' had vanished, and it was unknown if his work was finished or not. The area that would become Savannah was teeming with ley energy, Nodes of various sizes had been organized, plotted for some reason that the native Awakened could not divine. Fate Magic, Time, dreaming and trips into the Astral realms gave no clue as to the purpose of ''Hattan’s'' work. His secret had vanished with him, threads of fate had been severed, and his great work was useless to the remaining Awakened among the Native Americans. Right before Oglethorpe would land on American soil a new tribe of Indians, The Yamacraw, would form in preparation for the Arrival of settlers. Tomochichi, the first leader of the Yamacraw, would form his tribe from the survivors of the Yamasee and Creek who had disagreed with the breaking of the Friendship with the British during the Yamasee War. Little did Tomochichi know that the counsel he received was from many Awakened who knew of the impending arrival of English settlers. The tribe built a village near what is modern day Savannah, a supernal guard to make sure that the settlement would go unobstructed.%0a> %0a> James Oglethorpe arrived in 1732 with 114 colonists in tow. Several members of the Awakened were present, most notably the Mysterium and the Adamantine Arrow. The first act of these European Awakened was to contact their brethren in the Yamacraw. The resulted in the peaceful moving of the Yamacraw tribe farther North along the Savannah River, thus giving the Europeans free reign in the area. These plans all came from ''Gideon’s'' notes, his ideas, and his plans there were laid out almost 150 years prior to the arrival of the English. ''Hattan’s'' project was taken without bloodshed, and immediately the Awakened went to work.%0a> %0a> Some would like to think that Oglethorpe himself was a mage. The layout of Savannah was unique in its day, and remains so even now. %0a> %0a> http://wantonwicked.gamingsandbox.com/wiki/images/mta/history/mtahistory1.jpg%0a> %0a> The plan for the city was unlike earlier settlements, and built one stage atop the other in an ordered form. This unnatural city design, the way that it appeared to be geometrically and numerically precise and the way it captured the nodes left behind by ''Hattan'' was not unintentional, but it was not Oglethorpe who was the mage,%0a> %0a> %25lfloat text-align=center margin-top=5px margin-right=15px margin-bottom=5px margin-left=0px%25http://wantonwicked.gamingsandbox.com/wiki/images/mta/history/mtahistory2.jpg%0a> Each ward was preconceived  before the settlers had ever set foot on American soil, the note left by ''Gideon'' and ample use of Space and fate magic gave the travelling Awakened a virtual map to design with. Once they arrived they quickly adapted their plans and set forth in creating the street and block pattern that Savannah is now famous for. Oglethorpe, thinking the idea his own, quickly implemented this project, but it was the subtle guidance of the mages ''Ledger'' and ''Dragoon'' that gave Oglethorpe inspiration. %0a> %0a> Savannah quickly took shape, and while the European Awakened could not fathom ''Hattan’s'' plans any more than their Native American counterparts, they did create a wonder of their own. As the lands were shaped for the buildings and roads the ley lines began to move. Subtle changes at first, but the nodes and the lines began to parallel the creation of the city. Within a decade there were 12 wards, each one centered atop a node, ley lines of consistent power flowing between them, and then, something truly wondrous happened. Wondrous, and very dangerous.%0a> %0a> Hallows began to appear, producing tass in various forms, and then they would vanish. The Node system appeared to act as a battery, generating arcane power until it was full before a Hallow would appear and the mana would coalesce into tass. The first of these hallows appeared in 1745, twelve years after the founding of the city, but only 5 years after the completion of the last ward. The few Guardians of the Veil in the city were quick and careful to act, using smoke and mirrors to distract the populace as the Mysterium went to work harvesting the Tass. The hallow stayed active for a week, but the amount of tass retrieved before it disappearance was rumored to be 50 pawns. Had the Awakened stumbled on the purpose of ''Hattan’s''  Project? Did ''Hattan'' understand the concept of a battery well before one had ever been made?  The Consilium of Savannah met immediately after the hallow disappeared, their number was small, only 10 members largely comprised of the Mysterium and the Adamantine Arrow. The Guardians of the Veil member counseled caution, to wait and see if the event would happen again, before then deciding to tell other Consili about this wonder. The Silver Ladder balked at the Idea, wanting to share the information, and the wealth of the new world, to earn a place among the larger established Consili by right of their wonder. The Arrow agreed with the Guardians, their number was not great and there would be those who would try and take the wonder by force. They did not avoid the confrontation, but they counseled that only the desperate created a war they would lose. The Mysterium… said nothing. %0a> %0a> Eventually the compromise on patience won out, though party did agree to inform parent Consili and other Consili of this wonder should it repeat itself. The orders waited, the city grew, and time passed. There was certain anxiousness in the air for the first few years after the event. The Awakened watched as the ley lines seem to establish themselves. Geomancers among the wise were amazed at the intricate network that seemed vibrant enough to be self-contained.  Powerful lines left the city, heading towards South Carolina and the city of Charlestown, as well as to the West, towards what would become Atlanta. Another major artery headed south, into the Spanish territory of Florida. But the ley lines did not take magic in as much as they pushed magic out, Instead of one large node like a power plant, there was a grid of nodes producing enough ley energy that the stream only seemed to head away  from Savannah. The area around the city flourished, there were good yields in crops and in fauna. ''Hattan’s'' efforts, for whatever reason, had created something vibrant, something alive. There was less disease, fewer deaths from age, and people, in general, found a good life in Savannah.%0a> %0a> 1760, Fifteen years after the first hallow appeared, in the middle of a storm that had bracketed the coast for days, the second hallow appeared. Once again the Awakened quickly worked together, distracting the mortal population, which had grown since the last event, while harvesting the tass in the middle of the storm. Again, the Hallow remained active for a week, The awakened very carefully directed people away from the area, claiming other areas of the town needed assistance before working in the area the hallow had appeared. It was not the same location as the time before, instead appearing in a different ward.  This time the haul was larger, 75 pawns of tass pulled in just under a week. Each one carefully cultivated and separated from the Hallow. There were other more traditional hallows about Savannah, they would stay active if tended, and some cabals had found and tended to them for years, but nothing like these hallows produced by the node network.%0a> %0a> Just as before, the Consilium met, this time their numbers had grown, it had been years, and 20 awakened now returned to the argument of what to do with the knowledge, and the wonder, that they had found.%0a> %0a> http://wantonwicked.gamingsandbox.com/wiki/images/mta/history/mtahistory3.jpg%0a> %0a> %0a> %0a> [%25color=#365776%25[[#top| Back to top]]]%0a> %0a> [[#PT4]]%0a> !!Debate%0a> %0a> Savannah was larger, the Consilium was established and growing, and the hallows, with their caches of tass, had again appeared 15 years to the day after the first sighing of what some now called “''Hattan'' Hallows.” The Consilium had agreed to discuss what should be done if the event had occurred again, and  true to its word, the debate began. It was not a simple thing, instead a long and arduous process that divided orders on how they should respond. The worst division was in the Mysterium, some wanted to hide the wonder, study it, reverse engineer it workings. They believed that, in time, they could decipher the spells and the components of a device that did not appear to have a physical form. Others in the Mysterium felt that it was foolish not to utilize the resources of the order, to use the knowledge held in the Athenaeums of other cities. It was as close to kin-strife as it could be, with no few duels occurring because of slights, both supposed and real. The representatives of the other orders watched this internal war, smaller version of it playing out within their own orders. The Silver Ladder wanted to announce the wonder as a jewel of the Savannah Consilium, their idea was to parlay its existence for a bigger stake in the new colonies and for legitimization in the old world. Politics all the way, the Ladder had a few among them who cautioned with words like “Hubris” and “Hamartia.” The Adamantine Arrow, surprisingly, was also divided. There were those who felt that their defense of an object, a wonder such as this, was a way to gain recognition. The desire to sacrifice for the Consilium and the wise in service rang true in the ears of many, while others counseled patience, that the knowledge of such a wonder would draw more than just idle attention and curiosity. One of the few orders without strife was the Guardians of the Veil. They sought to protect the sleeping world from the machinations of the Awakened, and their policy was simple: hide what needed hidden, protect the Veil, and protect the Consilium.%0a> %0a> The final decision, reached a year after the Hallows had appeared and vanished, was made, and knowledge of the wonder was spread to various Consili. In North America an Envoy was sent first to South Carolina, Charleston being the nearest neighboring Consilium, before moving on to Jamestown and eventually Boston. Another envoy was sent to Europe, visiting the Consili of England. The Awakened of Savannah agreed that their work would not be shared with the French or Spanish Consili, some mundane superstitions and national pride still remained. The envoy to the Americas returned in just over a year, their travels brought with them a handful of new Awakened, mostly of the Mysterium and the Silver Ladder, but also returned with the most interesting of attitudes. The Northern Consili had reacted to the story of ''Hattan’s'' wonder with suspicion, with denial that something so grand would be found in the youngest of the Colonies. The Boston Consilium was the worst with,  “an attitude of superiority that was thicker than fresh butter” or so the envoy said. Those who arrived were welcomed, and offered chances to join the Savannah Consilium. Most of them, younger mages, took the opportunity with relish, like indentured servants being offered freedom, the mages agree and set to earning their way in the growing city. %0a> %0a> A year and a half later the envoy from Europe returned. The skepticism in Europe was even greater than that of Northern American Consili. The Envoy returned with stories of at least one duel, little in the way of support, but a chest of potential information for the budding Athenaeum from a sympathetic Mystagogue. The Silver Ladder hope of prestige was crushed, the Arrow desire for service was quelled and the Mysterium, which had fought long and hard with itself, licked its wounds in silence. The Guardians of the Veil, not yet numerous, stayed consistent with business as usual.  The Consilium grew, the work continued and the calendar was watched. Two times might have been happenstance; a third would be a pattern. In the remaining decade and some years the Awakened continued to grow, continued to work.  The secrecy of ''Hattan'' and the skill of his work eluded many of even the brightest minds researching the wonder. Time moved on, and Savannah believed that its overtures had been forgotten.%0a> %0a> %0a> [%25color=#365776%25[[#top| Back to top]]]%0a> %0a> [[#PT5]]%0a> !!Revolution%0a> %0a> 1775, and almost to the day, the Hallows once again appeared. Though, this time, there was more in the air than the excitement of another find. Once again the Hallows had appeared during the storm season, the winds and rains announcing the coming of a severe season were not the only terror that hung unseen in the future. The tensions between the Colonies and the parent were building. Those in Savannah knew there was something on the horizon, the Enchanters and those versed in time studied the signs, the omens, and it was on their words that the Consilium acted. The Acanthi saw the coming conflict, they saw the shrouded horsemen who travelled with every army sense time memorial.  Savannah would first fall, and then stand, its blood would run because of the actions of allies, and not of enemies. The Consilium prepared by harvesting the tass, now a little over 100 pawns, in the week the hallows remained. It was the third time this had happened, and the third time that the hallows had appeared in a different square. There was not enough information to predict which square, which ward of Savannah the hallow would appear in, but the timing was set, 15 years.%0a> %0a> The Mysterium went to looking into why 15 years might be significant. The number held no special weight with the Native American tribes, and there was nothing that seemed to tie it to the old world. The researchers continued, and in a daring move, helped fund the addition of another ward, this time with Mysterium and Sleepwalker workers excavating the ground among side the sleeping workforce. The project was a rush, how much could be done before the impending hostilities began. It was a tough time, there were many of the Wise who wished to counsel the Mayor and the Governor, warning them that there would be a time of violence, but to do so would threaten the secrecy of the Awakened. They instead waited, hiding caches of Tass should they be needed during the coming days.%0a> %0a> The ward was not finished when the American Revolution began, and within 2 years of the initial blows, Savannah found itself under the guns of the British Army.  3,000 men under the command of Colonel Archibald Campbell, laid siege to the city of Savannah during December of 1778, with Campbell’s army was a small cabal of Awakened, their presence was not a surprise, but their actions were. Campbell routed the Colonial forces and took possession of the city where he then proved to be a cosmopolitan and kind governor. He displayed an urbane method of treatment, allowing people to carry on with their daily lived with little intervention. He did not recruit or try to turn the population back into royal citizens, and would eventually return Savannah to the control of its then Royal Governor, James Wright.%0a> %0a> Campbell and his army would eventually move north to Aid in the pacification of South Carolina, Charleston especially, leaving a token force behind in Savannah. The city had not fulfilled the prophecy of bloodshed, and the new Cabal of Mages, all of them from England did nothing to change this. The Cabal of the Hidden Seam was a group of Mysterium and Arrows from Newcastle upon Tyne. Four men in all 2 from each order and representing the Moroi and Obrimoi paths, they had heard of the Savannah Envoy to England well after the envoy had returned to America. With time, and some effort, they had studied the information that had been left by the envoy with the Manchester and Edinburgh Consili, and they had decided to come to America to study the wonder. Even though they were part of the “invading” or “occupying” army, they swore an allegiance to the Consilium of Savannah and worked within the British Army to make the occupation a show of force. In all honesty, compared to other American cities, Savannah was spared the worst… for a while.%0a> %0a> Immediately the new members of the Consili proved that they were not there in name only. The four had copied and transcribed information recorded in the English Athenaeums, storing them in the ghost realm so that they would not be lost to the sea or to an army. They set to work reclaiming and reconstituting the information that they had hidden, adding greatly to the Athenaeum and its existing library. Their work was done in haste, it was only a matter of time before the Americans arrived to reclaim the city. Though the 4 Wise were saddened to learn that they had just missed the Hallows, they were buoyed by the opportunity to study and possibly witness the next advent of ''Hattan’s'' wonder. Stay true to the fifteen year cycle, they would only need to wait for 12 years, 12 years that they had no issue devoting to study. Their exuberance buoyed the Consilium   and all the orders set to creating new Identities for the four awakened so that come the end of hostilities, they could quickly fall into the fold.%0a> %0a> A year after Savannah fell to the British the American, with French allies, tried to retake the city. These were the nights of blood that the Enchanters saw. The American’s shelled the city, Artillery being used to disrupt the British only served to hammer the citizens and their homes. The assault failed with major casualties for the Americans and French. The Consilium used this time to try and sneak the cabal of British soldiers away from combat and into hiding, listing them among the lost in the combat. Sadly, one of the Arrows did indeed perish, but the three remaining members of the cabal survived and quietly took residence in Savannah as if they had been there all along.%0a> %0a> Savannah would remain in British hands until 1782 and it would be 8 years until the next advent of the ''Hattan'' Hallows. The Revolutionary war ended, and Savannah rebuilt. The Hallows did indeed return in 1790 and again in 1805, 1820, 1835 and then in 1850. Each year saw the amount of Tass increase, sometimes by just a few pawns, sometimes nearly doubling. A correlation was found, the amount of tass produced by the Hallows was directly proportional to the population. When the population so did the production of Tass, this idea was first thought off in 1820 when an epidemic of Yellow Fever tore through Savannah.   %0a> %0a> %0a> [%25color=#365776%25[[#top| Back to top]]]%0a> %0a> [[#PT6]]%0a> !!Growth%0a> %0a> Savannah continued to grow along with the rest of the United States. The hard won independence from England gave the new country its various freedoms along with new sets of problems. The first few years were difficult, but slowly a strong nation took shape. From the end of the Revolution and on into the early 1800’s there were times of prosperity, times were the wonder of the still new land amazed its inhabitants. This is not to say there were not problems. A series of wars with the Native Americans; The Creek War of 18131814, the First (181718) and Second (1835184 Seminole War eroded the goodwill that had once existed in Georgia between the settlers and the Native Americans. The War of 1812, again with England had a lasting effect in Georgia, one that would continue to rear its head for years to come.%0a> %0a> England had occupied Georgia easily during the revolution, and there was great fear that England would do so again in the War of 1812. While defenses were erected they were poorly equipped, maintained, and the communication between them was horrendous. The English Navy, then the most powerful navy the world had seen, had little trouble forming a blockade along the Eastern seaboard of the United States, including Savannah. The English made landfall at Cumberland, South of Savannah and North of what is now Jacksonville. Before the army could move north, the treaty of Ghent had been signed, and the War of 1812 was over, again, the effects would be felt for some time.%0a> %0a> During the occupation of Cumberland Island the British forces had conducted raids in Southern Georgia, freeing slaves and inciting rebellion against the state. After the war there was a time of turmoil as Georgians looked to quell these rebellions, and in a manner fit only for that time, “recapture their property.” It was a deplorable time, but slavery was far from being abolished, and the human trafficking would continue through the early 1800’s.  More and more legislation, or a Federal level, came into play regarding slavery, legislation that irritated the Southern States who relied so very heavily on slaves in their agrarian industry. It was a time heading for a boiling point, one that again loomed over the horizon.%0a> %0a> The Slavery issue affected the Consilium and the Wise as well, the first African Awakened in Savannah during the 1840’s. Sadly the racism that was rampant in the mundane world was not absent in the Awakened world. While the Savannah Consilium had accepted Native American Awakened, mostly in the form of Thyrsus and Acanthus members, the Awakening of a Slave caused difficulties the Consilium did not foresee.  The Consilium had to adapt, there was no doubt the woman, now called ''Orixa'', was Awakened, but she was still a slave, a piece of property of another, and the very idea shook the foundation of the Consilium. The debate over what to do with ''Orixa'' raged in the Consilium for a month until finally the order head of the Adamantine Arrow, an aged Adamant Sage known as Onager stepped to the fore of the discussion. Citing that ''Orixa'' already knew what it was like to live in constant conflict, and that she Awakened despite adversity and anyone else’s attempt to stop her, that she would have a home in the Adamantine Arrow, and that anyone who wished to contest his acceptance of this newly Awakened  woman was welcome to send their seconds to formally duel him.%0a> %0a> Many considered Onager a madman with this act, and Consilium records show that he had no less than three formal duels for his actions, three duels that he won in a fashion that his Obrimos nature could call divine intervention. ''Orixa'' joined the Adamantine Arrow, training first under Onager, but as her power and prowess grew, under her newly accepting family. ''Orixa'' was the first, but she was not the last. The Consilium records were not known to record the race of the Awakened in Savannah, but there was mention of color regarding no less than five members by 1850.  %0a> %0a> By the 1850’s, the Consilium was more cosmopolitan, at least in their own meetings, while continuing to appear to mundane friends and family as divided on the class distinction caused by race. There were still those who believed that those of color, any color, were inferior, and their attitudes were barely hidden at times, but the will of the Hierarch, and the strength of various members of the Consilium kept these views in check, save for one incident. During the late 1850’s there was a murder in the Consilium, supposedly spurred by an interracial relationship.  Consilium history is thin on evidence of the events, but there was, for the first time in Savannah, an Awakened killed by another Awakened. The names involved were removed from the History, and the event was, quickly covered up.%0a> %0a> %0a> [%25color=#365776%25[[#top| Back to top]]]%0a> %0a> [[#PT7]]%0a> !!Civil War%0a> %0a> 1850 saw another series of ‘’Hattan'' Hallows appear and the haul was the largest amount of Tass collected yet. Savannah had a population of over 15,000, making it the largest city in Southeastern Georgia. The total population of the State was close to 525,000 and would grow in the next 10 years to over 1 million people.  From 1850 to 1860 the Obrimos of Savannah quietly worked on mapping the ley lines of Savannah, a project that had been started and stopped many times before. By 1860 the map was done, and it was strange in a way that surprised no one. The map showed an almost perfect grid aligned with the construction of the wards in downtown Savannah. From there, spoke appeared to head off, the spokes were strong, thicker in some ways, than the lines connecting the grid in downtown Savannah. It was during this time that another aspect of ''Hattan’s'' project was noticed. None of the ley line spokes; which appeared to head to Charleston, Sc. via Hilton Head, to Macon then on to Atlanta, Ga., and another to Columbia, Ga., none of the spokes returned power to Savannah. The Ley Lines appeared to be one way, and one way only, emanating outwards from the city. The Surprise did not end there, but in 1855, with the expansion of Jacksonville Florida, a new spoke appeared leaving the Southern Tip of the City and heading towards the younger Floridian City. The confirmation that the new line did indeed make it all the way to Jacksonville was establish by 1860, the same year that it was confirmed that the other spokes made their ways to the other cities.%0a> %0a> While these surprises were positive moment in the lives of the Wise, there were again the Omens of conflict and war. The argument on races, on color, had reached a fever pitch in the Congress. Threats had been made, if a man by the name of Abraham Lincoln ascended to the Presidency, there would be repercussions. The Wise of Savannah were not perfect, they had started, albeit slowly, to accent the Awakened amongst the slave population, but it was still slow to change. The idea of Slavery was abhorrent to many, yet seemed to be accepted based on the color of one’s skin. The Awakened were changing, unlike the sleepers around them, but they had to be careful not to let it show. It was a difficult time, and was about to get worse. The American Civil War began because of the City of Charleston, and among them the wise of Charleston, fired upon Fort Sumter in the Charleston harbor. Secession began, and Georgia would be the fifth of Eleven States to secede from the Union.%0a> %0a> At first the secession appeared to work, the battles, fought mostly in Virginia and Tennessee, were far enough away that one could almost believe there was not fighting going on. The war took its toll, and one year became five, a blockade once again stifled commerce, and the population dwindled as men went off to never return. Then, in 1864, the unthinkable happened. William Tecumseh Sherman took Control of Atlanta Georgia in September of 1864, and breaking with tradition, did not collect his forces and move towards a secure port for provisions. Instead, he began his “March to the Sea,” heading toward the Atlantic. Most of Georgia did not know his true intentions, but the Wise of Savannah did, the end of the march would bring Sherman to Savannah. Sherman waged a war unlike any seen before him, a new concept known as Total War, nothing escaped the sword where he went and the Wise were aware of this.%0a> %0a> The Awakened were also aware that there were no few number of Northern Awakened travelling with Sherman’s Army. While some of the Awakened were bound to be from Consili in the North, the Wise in Savannah felt there would also be those who did not follow the ways of the Diamond orders. A sacking was in the making, but the problem, for the wise of Savannah, was that there was nothing left to sack. ''Hattan’s'' Hallows would not appear for another year and they most certainly did not want an occupying army in the city when that happened. By November Sherman was drawing near and something had to be done.%0a> %0a> It was two Awakened of the Mysterium, an Obrimos, ''Flare'', and a Moros, ''Locust'', who proposed a solution. Both had studied the wonder left by ''Hattan'' since their acceptance into the Mysterium. ''Flare'' had been one of the many Obrimos who had studied the ley lines and their odd conveyance of energy and ''Locust'' had tried to relearn the ancient prime focused earth-sculpting that ''Hattan'' had mastered. It was their thought that the device left by ''Hattan'' could be “turned off” for a limited amount of time. That the wonder could be diverted so that hallows did not appear, potentially strengthening the ley lines to other cities, but reducing the creation of tass in Savannah, thus hiding the true wonder from an Invading army. With the Hierarch’s blessing they began to work. %0a> %0a> ''Flare'' made notes on everything that he and ''Locust'' did. Rumor has it they forged rods of adamantine imbued with prime, rods said to be “three times the height of a man and as thick around as an arm… .” It took time. They were hurried, but they did not rush. The rods were to act like pins inside a lock, each one set at a different spot, a different depth. The rods, once set in place, would be hidden from mage sight, their threads cut so that no one mage could remove them without knowing where they were placed. The work was complete during the last days of November 1864, Sherman’s army was near the periphery of Savannah. The Awakened of Savannah prepared a delegation to ride out and meet with the approaching Wise. As the delegation left ''Flare'' and ''Locust'' went to work, placing the rods inside the nodes, the pattern kept secret only to be passed along to the Hierarch themselves. %0a> %0a> The delegation of Southern awakened was welcomed by their Northern counterparts. Conversation was cordial, concern about their health and the strength of the Consilium seemed to be the first topic of Conversation. There was no mention about ''Hattan’s'' at first, instead, business was done the old way, the, surprisingly, Southern way. At the mention of the wonder it was one of the Northern Awakened who answered the hanging question. The Northern Wise were there to help the Consilium of Savannah protect the wonder. Auguries and precognitions in the North had omens of a great wonder, hidden in the lands of the wayward sleepers that would come under attack from within. Since Savannah was the only city with such a wonder, and since earlier communication had never been responded to, the Consili had drafted men from the Western Consili to try and make it to Savannah.%0a> %0a> The Southern Awakened were shocked, they denied having ever received an inquiry or a message regarding this dire event. A panic took over the collected wise and the members from the Savannah Consilium, with an escort from the Northern Wise, returned to Savannah with all haste. There they found that events had transpired worse than they could imagine. ''Locust'' was dead, left murdered in Liberty Square. Of ''Flare'', there was no word. The research that went along with the project, the location of the adamantine rods, everything had been taken or destroyed. The Athenaeum had been attacked, parts of the building smoldered from arcane blasts, the inside held strong, but there was no way those inside could have known what was going on. The deed had been done, there were too many questions, not enough answers.%0a> %0a> Savannah surrendered to Sherman December of 1864, Sherman, like Campbell before him, was charitable towards the citizens of Savannah, he did as he promised, and showed Mercy, leaving the city intact. Within a Month he was gone, marching into South Carolina on his continued campaign. Among those he left behind were the dozen or so Awakened from the North. With their help, a manhunt began. The trail left by ''Flare'', was obscured, but was not impossible to track. During this search many things came to light. ''Flare'' had been a Seer, originally from the South he was Northern educated, more time and more resources were spent tracking this lone mage down. The next year, 1865, during the appointed month, the Hallows did not appear. The sorrow was equaled in anger, the despair matched with rage. The Consilium of Savannah, as a whole, declared Nemesis on the Awakened Seer known as ''Flare'', and sent this declaration to all surviving established Consili in both the North and the South. The Civil War ended, but a hidden war was just being born.%0a> %0a> 1865 passed, as did 1880, and then 1895, the third cycle was again missed, the Hallows didn’t appear, but there was a conclusion to the story started 31 years prior. ''Flare'' was eventually found in Chicago in 1895. In the 30 years he had been on the lamb, members of the Savannah Consilium had destroyed no less than 15 pylons and disrupted multiple tetrarchies in their pursuit of this one mage. Some of the lost work had been recovered, or copies of the notes made about the project, were occasionally acquired, but ''Flare'' had escaped notice. ''Flare'' had been bartering knowledge for protection and power, but it did nothing to protect him from a wrath of a city. Members of the Savannah Adamantine Arrow cornered ''Flare'' in Rockford Park, Chicago, and forced him to combat. ''Flare'' died in December 1895, taking with him most of the information he had stolen to his grave. That would seem to be sad, but fitting end, to the Seer who had committed such an act against the Consilium of Savannah, but it was not the end. Two Mysterium Moros were with the arrow at ''Flare’s''’ demise, the chained and bound his soul, brought him back the Athenaeum, and proceeded to strip the information from his remaining mind before finally destroying him. It was not one of the better moments for the Mysterium, but it brought closure to a dark Chapter in the history of the city.%0a> %0a> %0a> [%25color=#365776%25[[#top| Back to top]]]%0a> %0a> [[#PT8]]%0a> !!The Free Council%0a> %0a> The Reconstruction was hard on the South, especially in Georgia where Sherman had taken life by the throat, shaken it repeatedly and thrown it on the ground. Savannah had escaped the physical violence that Atlanta, Columbia and other cities had experience, but the psychological damage was still there. A way of life had been shattered, and to make the recovery more complex, there were those in the North who took advantage of the situation. Charleston was the premier port on the Eastern seaboard but Savannah still made major contributions in foodstuffs, and of course, cotton.%0a> %0a> The loss of the Hallows changed the Consilium in some ways, the Mysterium became focused on recovering the information stolen and destroyed by ''Flare''. Of the five rods sank into the nodes 2 had been found, and they still remained. Somehow the rods had bonded with the nodes, becoming hard to distinguish between the two. There was no idea on how to separate them, and if ''Flare'' did know, not even his ghost gave up that information. The Consilium developed an entire section of their Athenaeum to the study of the wonder. They became withdrawn for some time, the object of their studies had been sullied under their noses and they grew despondent after ''Flare'' was destroyed. The hopes of regaining some of the lost knowledge had buoyed them, and the drop from hope was felt by the entire order. The Silver Ladder worked hard to hold things together, to try and stave off the melancholy caused by rebuilding. The Guardians of the Veil and the Arrows, both having been on war footing for so long, took time to acclimate back into society. It was a difficult era, a time of confusion and questions.%0a> %0a> Odd that this occurred during the same time as the birth of the Free Council, a time during the refusal, when so many Wise were disillusioned with the old way, looking for something new, something that they could hold on to. The Birth of Free Council was keenly felt in Savannah, many decided that the old ways were not for them, had cost them too much. The apostasy to join this fledgling order hit the Mysterium the hardest, followed closely by the Arrow and even some Ladders and Guardians felt the need to change. In other cities, where there was bloodshed and violence, there was a malaise that was hanging over Savannah, one that took the wind out of sails. The Free Council was not exactly accepted, but it was barely fought. For once apathy successfully stopped violence and bloodshed, but the spiral the Consilium and the Wise were in was not healthy. For close to 40 years the Consilium had been at war, the loss of an enemy was also a loss of identity as they had used resource after resource to chase after ''Flare''. They needed to regroup, and it was the Seers who once again provided them with the opportunity.%0a> %0a> It was the most mundane thing really, the Boll Weevil, a form of beetle that seemed unassuming, yet was incredibly destructive, was the enemy. In 1915 small infestations begin to appear in Savannah’s cotton farms. By 1920 it is epidemic proportions. At first the Thyrsus Silver Ladder and the Mysterium sought to contain the Weevil’s using life magic, but it was apparent that this was something more than just an infestation. It was the members of the Free Council, looking for answers outside of nature and the overt, that saw the hands of the Seers of the Throne involved with the Weevil infestation. Once again the Seers were attacking Savannah, trying to destroy its use to the Diamond, now Pentacle orders. The Free Council became the vanguard in the fight not only against the insect infestation, but against the Seers themselves. This dedication to the other Awakened gave rise to the spirits of the Consilium members, once again they had a common purpose, and again they were united. %0a> %0a> The Destruction of crops was rampant, but once again Savannah survived. The Consilium had been taxed heavily, but it too survived. The Free Council was accepted, faster than many other Consili had accepted the upstart order. Savannah would continue on.%0a> %0a> The ''Hattan'' Hallows did not appear in 1910, nor in 1925 or 1940. By 1940 the Consilium was strong again and the population of Savannah had grown to almost 100,000 people and the Consilium had grown to match. A new conflict was waiting in the wings, one that would take place far away from Savannah, but a conflict that would still have an effect on the city. War spread across Europe, and the Consilium prepared to send aid to its one time parent Consili in England. Since 1860 Savannah had spent more than 40 years in one form of conflict or another. They had experience in survival, in fortitude, and they could feel, even without arcana, the weight that was pressing against Europe. %0a> %0a> %0a> [%25color=#365776%25[[#top| Back to top]]]%0a> %0a> [[#PT9]]%0a> !!The Sacking of the Athenaeum%0a> %0a> World Wars I and II passed, and then there was Korea. The fighting was abroad, Vietnam was beginning to build, and the effect was felt stateside in a variety of ways. There was constant conflict yet none of it at home, at least, nothing like the battlefields in Europe and Asia. A different war was brewing at home, Civil Rights, the age old question of color taken to a national level by the likes of Rosa Parks, Martin Luther King Jr., and Malcolm X rocked the nation with act of civil disobedience and speeches. The nation felt the stamp of a million feet, Georgia did not escape this time of change, nor did Savannah.%0a> %0a> While Atlanta took a spotlight with marches and protests, Savannah quietly persevered. The work done in the 1800’s by the Consilium had done much for equal right among the awakened, and now the mortal population was keeping up. The Consilium used their magic, carefully, to smooth out tensions, to ease the people into a future. Massive works of mind and life, fate and time, were cast around the city, the Consilium did not want Savannah to see another siege, this time from within. By 1940 Savannah’s population was over 50%25 black or of mixed race, one of the largest percentages in America, The Consilium saw the writing on the wall, the transition to a new day was smoother than in other cities, some hatreds and fear could never be defeated, but that was not Savannah’s problem.%0a> %0a> The Hallows did not return in 1940, nor did they return in 1955. For a while there was hope, the nodes seemed to grow stronger with the increase in population, the Ley Lines pulsed with an amazing brilliance and Prime users found ways to siphon off some of the residual energy. It was during this time that the modern day Savannah Athenaeum was founded. The building that still houses the Mysterium’s grand library was built, and during one quiet night, over half of its power supply was converted from electricity to energy from a nearby node. It was a grand time, the lore recovered from chasing ''Flare'' added with the nearly 300 years of history and study, made the Savannah Athenaeum one of the great treasures of the Southeast. The subject were many, Ghost and spirits, native American occult, the ''Hattan'' Project, the Weevil wars, Southern Cooking and even a section on the Seers. What made the library special was not the ''Hattan'' information, but a section dedicated entirely to omens, oracles and auguries that had been recorded since the founding of the City. Sometimes these portents were not understood until the event was happen, the predictions were many and varied; often esoteric or hidden in gibberish. Some of the records were never understood, and the members of the Mysterium did not know if that was because the events they describe had not taken place, or the translation was just wrong.%0a> %0a> Despite the racial tensions, the Consilium was strong. It had weathered many storms, and it had persevered and continued to grow. Not as large as Charleston or Atlanta, and spared the ravage of the Civil War and Sherman’s march, Savannah was a bastion of the Old South. For some time there truly was peace in the city, which made the events in 1962 even more shocking.%0a> %0a> In what could only be called a fit of madness an Awakened Mage  studying in the Athenaeum set fire to the room containing the oracles as well as much of the information on ''Hattan’s'' wonder. This was the second time the pages of information were lost, and this time, due to the Awakeneds' knowledge of death, they truly were lost. Members of the Mysterium tried to subdue the Magi; two died in the attempt and one more never regained their sanity. The used of mastery levels of time and fate was awesome to behold, terrifying yet awesome, and the remaining Mystagogue had a choice; save their Athenaeum or fight the magus. They chose to save their works and the Wise, whose name has been lost to time, with threads and fate hiding them away from others, fled. %0a> %0a> The magus took nothing with them, at least that is what was thought. There is strong suspicion that “the Eternal Now” or a variant was used. Many conflicting thoughts and memories of the event remained. No two stories seemed to add up, and when the Mysterium looked through its ranks, no one could remember enough to identify the mage who performed this act. What was known was this was not an attack by the Seers of the Throne, this was not a theft. The magus, male or female was never agreed on, vanished, leaving nothing behind and taking nothing, to the knowledge of curators, with them. Instead they left ash and death, there was no vengeance like there was on ''Flare'', to be had. The Mysterium licked its wounds, saved what it could, and put safeguards in play that would never allow this event to happen again.%0a> %0a> %0a> [%25color=#365776%25[[#top| Back to top]]]%0a> %0a> [[#PT10]]%0a> !!Turn of the Century%0a> %0a> Savannah grew quiet for many years, the city continued to grow, out shadowed by Atlanta as Georgia’s premier city. Atlanta was the capital, the switch had occurred over 100 years ago, and Savannah seemed to move along just a little slows after the transition. By the latter half of the 20th century Savannah had become the fourth largest city behind Atlanta, Augusta and Columbia. If there was a depreciation in prestige it was not felt, Savannah was still the first city of Georgia, and in many ways, its jewel. The Athenaeum rebuilt, the Consilium grew, and the city, in many ways was thriving.%0a> %0a> Sadly, the actions taken by the Consilium in pursuing ''Flare'' after the Civil War had earned it animosity outside of the normal antagonism between the Pentacle and the Seers of the Throne. The early 1980’s saw a refusal war for the city conducted between the Adamantine Arrows and the Guardians of the Veil against the Seers of the Throne. Casualties mounted, the Adamantine Arrow taking the brunt of the damage. By the mid-nineties the Arrow was spent, achieving a hollow victory in holding the city with their order shattered. It was at this time that the future Adamant Sage ''Kreig'' appeared in Savannah. Through sheer force of will he rebuilt and reformed the Arrow. The Guardians had fared better, but their shadow war with the Seers continued. %0a> %0a> The final act of the refusal war was the refurbishing of Coastal State Prison, a Federal Correctional institution that the Seers entrenched themselves in. A peace, if you would call it that, was called, though neither side ever completely gave up on the eternal war between the dogmatic factions. The Arrows rebuilt and restructured, ''Kreig’s'' methods were efficient and the Seers retreated behind the walls of bureaucracy.  A watchful peace was still a peace, and the Consilium continued to grow.%0a> %0a> In the late nineties ''Titus'' of the Silver Ladder ascended to the Hierarch, and for a while there was a “Golden Age” for the Consilium. After so many struggles, after years of conflict, both mundane and supernal, the city seemed at peace. The enemy was near, but they were known. The works of the Mysterium flourished, the Free Council created changed, the Guardians of the Veil hid the works of the wise from the mundane world, the Adamantine Arrow waited, ready to defend, and the Silver Ladder lead by example. For the moment the Consilium was stable, strong, and in league with one another to make the city a better place for Wise and sleeper alike.%0a> %0a> The calm was enjoyed by many, the peace a treat after so many years of struggle and adversity. The hallows had not returned and for a moment that was not a worry. Many dedicated themselves to the study of the ancient wonder, Mysterium mages found able and willing helpers from the other orders in trying to unravel the work of ''Flare''. For some, worry set in, it is always calm before a storm, and while many wished to forget, some would not.%0a> %0a> %0a> [%25color=#365776%25[[#top| Back to top]]]%0a> %0a> [[#PT11]]%0a> !!Modern Nights%0a> %0a> Coming Soon%0a> %0a> [%25color=#365776%25[[#top| Back to top]]]%0a

Modern Savannah is built on the lands once held by the Guale Indians. With the Timucua to the South and the Creek Indians to the West, the Gaule held a fertile section of what would eventually become Georgia. Their Lands extended north to the future border of South Carolina and their Eastern extent was the Atlantic Ocean. The Guale had seen the incursion of the French, and of the Spanish, and though their Awakened numbers were small, they were organized under the Leadership of the Guale Shaman known only as ''Hattan''.  ''Hattan'', both a shaman for his people and a Thyrsus, had tilled and worked the land with his own hands, he was a supposed master of the Life and Spirit arcanas, and if the rumors were true, was also a master of prime as well. The lands of the Guale were lush, and were coveted by the Yamasee and Creek tribes. Because of this, the Guale were constantly in a defensive state, not looking to expand their boarders as much as seeking to protect what they already had.%0a%3c %0a%3c It was 1563 and an expedition  led by Jean Ribault, a French naval officer, brought ''Hattan'' in contact with a member of the Awakened from Europe.  Among Ribault’s party was a mage known as ''Gideon''.  ''Gideon'' had joined Ribault’s party as a spiritual advisor, though his other mission was a bit more serious. ''Gideon'' was an advance scout sent by the Paris Consilium meant to make contact with the Awakened in the New World.  Most of ''Gideon’s'' accounts were of modern day South Carolina, but as Ribault moved farther south ''Gideon'' would encounter  ''Hattan'' and the Gaule. Luckily ''Gideon'' was wise enough to come as a supplicant and not a conqueror, and an uneasy friendship was struck up. ''Hattan'' learned of the organization and the size of the European Awakened, and ''Gideon'' learned of something far greater. ''Hattan'' had been shaping the land and the ley lines in a project that had taken most of his life. Slow cultivation of the powerful nodes of Awakened Magic, it was ''Hattan’s'' Mission to create a self-sustaining network of nodes that would nourish the land, and the people in turn.%0a%3c %0a%3c ''Gideon'' was wise enough to display awe instead of a more covetous nature. ''Gideon'' knew he had to report of this experiment to the Paris Consilium, but had no means to do so until Ribault pushed on. Acting as counsel to Ribault, he convinced the French explorer to push farther South and into the lands of the Spaniards in the hopes of contacting more of the Awakened from the old world. With feigned reluctance, ''Gideon'' took his leave of ''Hattan'', a new mission assigned by himself, now of paramount importance.  ''Hattan'', who was cautious, did not know of ''Gideon’s'' f thoughts, and had little choice in what he must do. ''Hattan'' began redoubled his efforts on his project, his goal to see his people prosper and be protected the forefront thought in his mind.%0a%3c %0a%3c ''Gideon'' would continue to travel with Ribault until Ribault and many of his party were ambushed and killed near the Spanish Settlement of St. Augustine. ''Gideon'' was taken “prisoner” by an Awakened member of the Spaniard contingent, an Adamantine Arrow known as ''Falchion''.  ''Falchion'' arranged for ''Gideon’s'' ransom under the guise of ''Gideon'' being a Roman Catholic priest. _''Gideon'' was careful not to mention ''Hattan'' or his project, keeping that information for his superiors. ''Gideon'' feared that the Spanish Awakened would act before he could report his findings to his colleagues in Paris, and so ''Gideon'' waited, suffering the trip across the Atlantic with a barely contained excitement. ''Hattan’s'' work, in this wild and untamed land, was something not seen in Europe, a place where boundaries and cities had been established for centuries.%0a%3c %0a%3c %0a%3c [%25color=#365776%25[[#top| Back to top]]]%0a%3c %0a%3c %0a%3c [[#PT2]]%0a%3c !!Change%0a%3c %0a%3c ''Gideon'' did survive his travel back to the Paris Consilium, but the greeting he expected from his order, and the Consilium, was less than he had hoped for. Seers had pushed against the Paris Consilium, and there was an open war fought with rapier and main gauche, covert spells and assassinations, that filled the streets of Paris. ''Gideon’s'' news of a fantastic experiment in the New World was not worthy enough of his order’s full attention, there was a price in blood that was the forefront thought of the Consilium, and the Consilium had been martialed for war. ''Gideon'', knowing that the war was likely to be a long one, looked for other options. In a series of political moves, ''Gideon'' was assigned as an ambassador of his order to other cities and other Consili. For the next 10 years ''Gideon'' travelled throughout France, looking for a Consilium to fund a voyage back to the New World. He was met with political infighting and skepticism. The Old World had seen, had done, it all. How had such a wild land been able to produce greater works than the Masters of Europe? ''Gideon'' was not a man of prophecy, his knowledge of fate and time was a hindrance, but he had his own vision of ''Hattan’s'' project, one that was for the benefit of the European Awakened as they made it to the New World. It was in desperation that ''Gideon'' made what some might consider a deal with a Devil. It was 1575 when ''Gideon'' left France and made his way to England, specifically, the Consilium of London.%0a%3c %0a%3c The English were much more receptive to the information that ''Gideon''  Provided. There were no English settlements in the New World at this time, and ''Gideon’s'' tales of the new World Sparked an excitement within the Consilium of London. ''Gideon'' would spend the rest of his time in England, knowing that he would be considered a pariah in his home country and the Paris Consilium. Through a network of contacts, ''Gideon'' learned that the Paris Consilium was bled close to dry in the war with the Seers, a war that lasted two years. This was one of the last things ''Gideon'' would learn, he succumbed to the outbreak of Typhus in the city of Oxford in 1577. His work, however, spurred the Awakened to push the English colonization of the New World. In 1578 Walter Raleigh would lead the first expedition to the New World, only to be turned back. It would not be until 1607 that the English would finally make a foothold in North America with the settlement of Jamestown ion 1607.%0a%3c ''Hattan'' had not been idle during this time, though he had become a recluse in many ways. His project took all of his time, the crafting of land pushed his knowledge of the Supernal and of the mundane world to new heights. In the time ''Gideon'' had been gone ''Hattan'' and reshaped and moved nodes, healed and created new ley lines, altered the geography of the land, and worked incessantly on his wonder. His focus was drifting away from the fallen world and was taking him on a path to greater understanding of the supernal. He became a living myth to his people, the shaman of the shamans. There was even talk of him becoming a living ancestor, an avatar of the spirits of the Gaule.%0a%3c %0a%3c While ''Hattan'' delved deeper into the supernal his people fought to survive. Never warlike, the Gaule were hard pressed to survive with the  warlike Creek as their neighbor. First influenced by the French, the Spanish soon took an interest in the Guele and tried desperately to incorporate them into their Mission System of colonization. At first the Guale  seemed to acclimate to the Spanish, but the Guale were too far away from the powerbase the Spanish had in St. Augustine. As a mission province, the Guale were unstable, and in 1597 there was a revolt against the system. Part of the Guale ability to survive was the continued relationship with the French, one kept in secret, which allowed them to avoid the full incorporation into the Spanish System.%0a%3c %0a%3c For a while there was an uneasy balance of power, the Guale continued to survive, but each year saw them holding on with less of a grip to their ancestral lands. The English colonization of the mid-Atlantic was comparatively quick. After the settlement of Jamestown in Virginia the English quickly asserted themselves up and down the Atlantic seaboard. In 1670 the English founded their southernmost settlement with Charleston. By 1675 Indian tribes supported by the British were attacking and destroying missions created by the Spanish. Because this was done by Native Americans the Spanish were unable to hold the English accountable. For most this seemed simple nationalistic combat, countries fighting over new resources. While the Spanish have no record of Awakened involvement, the London Consilium knows full and well that the Awakened pushed many of these combats. They were fueled with the knowledge left behind by ''Gideon'', and their own resources with fate told of a great wonder being created in the lands of the Guale.%0a%3c %0a%3c Though it is not talked about, it is said that an order of Awakened introduced various diseases into the area to force the Guale into capitulation. Small Pox, Typhus, and other diseases ravaged the natives, forcing them to create amalgamation of tribes that would be called the Yamasee.  For several years this group would try to exist despite disease and intertribal warfare.  After the Yamasee wars in South Carolina, and with the British Invasion of Florida in 1702, the Yamasee, nee Guale, were virtually extinct. Of ''Hattan'' and his work there was no word, ''Hattan'' had vanished sometime in the 1600’s and had not been heard of save for the myths and the legends of his people. There was no news of his wonder, or his work. The British were ready to create a settlement, and in 30 years, Savannah would be born.%0a%3c %0a%3c %0a%3c [%25color=#365776%25[[#top| Back to top]]]%0a%3c %0a%3c [[#PT3]]%0a%3c !!Savannah%0a%3c %0a%3c ''Hattan'' had vanished, and it was unknown if his work was finished or not. The area that would become Savannah was teeming with ley energy, Nodes of various sizes had been organized, plotted for some reason that the native Awakened could not divine. Fate Magic, Time, dreaming and trips into the Astral realms gave no clue as to the purpose of ''Hattan’s'' work. His secret had vanished with him, threads of fate had been severed, and his great work was useless to the remaining Awakened among the Native Americans. Right before Oglethorpe would land on American soil a new tribe of Indians, The Yamacraw, would form in preparation for the Arrival of settlers. Tomochichi, the first leader of the Yamacraw, would form his tribe from the survivors of the Yamasee and Creek who had disagreed with the breaking of the Friendship with the British during the Yamasee War. Little did Tomochichi know that the counsel he received was from many Awakened who knew of the impending arrival of English settlers. The tribe built a village near what is modern day Savannah, a supernal guard to make sure that the settlement would go unobstructed.%0a%3c %0a%3c James Oglethorpe arrived in 1732 with 114 colonists in tow. Several members of the Awakened were present, most notably the Mysterium and the Adamantine Arrow. The first act of these European Awakened was to contact their brethren in the Yamacraw. The resulted in the peaceful moving of the Yamacraw tribe farther North along the Savannah River, thus giving the Europeans free reign in the area. These plans all came from ''Gideon’s'' notes, his ideas, and his plans there were laid out almost 150 years prior to the arrival of the English. ''Hattan’s'' project was taken without bloodshed, and immediately the Awakened went to work.%0a%3c %0a%3c Some would like to think that Oglethorpe himself was a mage. The layout of Savannah was unique in its day, and remains so even now. %0a%3c %0a%3c http://wantonwicked.gamingsandbox.com/wiki/images/mta/history/mtahistory1.jpg%0a%3c %0a%3c The plan for the city was unlike earlier settlements, and built one stage atop the other in an ordered form. This unnatural city design, the way that it appeared to be geometrically and numerically precise and the way it captured the nodes left behind by ''Hattan'' was not unintentional, but it was not Oglethorpe who was the mage,%0a%3c %0a%3c %25lfloat text-align=center margin-top=5px margin-right=15px margin-bottom=5px margin-left=0px%25http://wantonwicked.gamingsandbox.com/wiki/images/mta/history/mtahistory2.jpg%0a%3c Each ward was preconceived  before the settlers had ever set foot on American soil, the note left by ''Gideon'' and ample use of Space and fate magic gave the travelling Awakened a virtual map to design with. Once they arrived they quickly adapted their plans and set forth in creating the street and block pattern that Savannah is now famous for. Oglethorpe, thinking the idea his own, quickly implemented this project, but it was the subtle guidance of the mages ''Ledger'' and ''Dragoon'' that gave Oglethorpe inspiration. %0a%3c %0a%3c Savannah quickly took shape, and while the European Awakened could not fathom ''Hattan’s'' plans any more than their Native American counterparts, they did create a wonder of their own. As the lands were shaped for the buildings and roads the ley lines began to move. Subtle changes at first, but the nodes and the lines began to parallel the creation of the city. Within a decade there were 12 wards, each one centered atop a node, ley lines of consistent power flowing between them, and then, something truly wondrous happened. Wondrous, and very dangerous.%0a%3c %0a%3c Hallows began to appear, producing tass in various forms, and then they would vanish. The Node system appeared to act as a battery, generating arcane power until it was full before a Hallow would appear and the mana would coalesce into tass. The first of these hallows appeared in 1745, twelve years after the founding of the city, but only 5 years after the completion of the last ward. The few Guardians of the Veil in the city were quick and careful to act, using smoke and mirrors to distract the populace as the Mysterium went to work harvesting the Tass. The hallow stayed active for a week, but the amount of tass retrieved before it disappearance was rumored to be 50 pawns. Had the Awakened stumbled on the purpose of ''Hattan’s''  Project? Did ''Hattan'' understand the concept of a battery well before one had ever been made?  The Consilium of Savannah met immediately after the hallow disappeared, their number was small, only 10 members largely comprised of the Mysterium and the Adamantine Arrow. The Guardians of the Veil member counseled caution, to wait and see if the event would happen again, before then deciding to tell other Consili about this wonder. The Silver Ladder balked at the Idea, wanting to share the information, and the wealth of the new world, to earn a place among the larger established Consili by right of their wonder. The Arrow agreed with the Guardians, their number was not great and there would be those who would try and take the wonder by force. They did not avoid the confrontation, but they counseled that only the desperate created a war they would lose. The Mysterium… said nothing. %0a%3c %0a%3c Eventually the compromise on patience won out, though party did agree to inform parent Consili and other Consili of this wonder should it repeat itself. The orders waited, the city grew, and time passed. There was certain anxiousness in the air for the first few years after the event. The Awakened watched as the ley lines seem to establish themselves. Geomancers among the wise were amazed at the intricate network that seemed vibrant enough to be self-contained.  Powerful lines left the city, heading towards South Carolina and the city of Charlestown, as well as to the West, towards what would become Atlanta. Another major artery headed south, into the Spanish territory of Florida. But the ley lines did not take magic in as much as they pushed magic out, Instead of one large node like a power plant, there was a grid of nodes producing enough ley energy that the stream only seemed to head away  from Savannah. The area around the city flourished, there were good yields in crops and in fauna. ''Hattan’s'' efforts, for whatever reason, had created something vibrant, something alive. There was less disease, fewer deaths from age, and people, in general, found a good life in Savannah.%0a%3c %0a%3c 1760, Fifteen years after the first hallow appeared, in the middle of a storm that had bracketed the coast for days, the second hallow appeared. Once again the Awakened quickly worked together, distracting the mortal population, which had grown since the last event, while harvesting the tass in the middle of the storm. Again, the Hallow remained active for a week, The awakened very carefully directed people away from the area, claiming other areas of the town needed assistance before working in the area the hallow had appeared. It was not the same location as the time before, instead appearing in a different ward.  This time the haul was larger, 75 pawns of tass pulled in just under a week. Each one carefully cultivated and separated from the Hallow. There were other more traditional hallows about Savannah, they would stay active if tended, and some cabals had found and tended to them for years, but nothing like these hallows produced by the node network.%0a%3c %0a%3c Just as before, the Consilium met, this time their numbers had grown, it had been years, and 20 awakened now returned to the argument of what to do with the knowledge, and the wonder, that they had found.%0a%3c %0a%3c http://wantonwicked.gamingsandbox.com/wiki/images/mta/history/mtahistory3.jpg%0a%3c %0a%3c %0a%3c %0a%3c [%25color=#365776%25[[#top| Back to top]]]%0a%3c %0a%3c [[#PT4]]%0a%3c !!Debate%0a%3c %0a%3c Savannah was larger, the Consilium was established and growing, and the hallows, with their caches of tass, had again appeared 15 years to the day after the first sighing of what some now called “''Hattan'' Hallows.” The Consilium had agreed to discuss what should be done if the event had occurred again, and  true to its word, the debate began. It was not a simple thing, instead a long and arduous process that divided orders on how they should respond. The worst division was in the Mysterium, some wanted to hide the wonder, study it, reverse engineer it workings. They believed that, in time, they could decipher the spells and the components of a device that did not appear to have a physical form. Others in the Mysterium felt that it was foolish not to utilize the resources of the order, to use the knowledge held in the Athenaeums of other cities. It was as close to kin-strife as it could be, with no few duels occurring because of slights, both supposed and real. The representatives of the other orders watched this internal war, smaller version of it playing out within their own orders. The Silver Ladder wanted to announce the wonder as a jewel of the Savannah Consilium, their idea was to parlay its existence for a bigger stake in the new colonies and for legitimization in the old world. Politics all the way, the Ladder had a few among them who cautioned with words like “Hubris” and “Hamartia.” The Adamantine Arrow, surprisingly, was also divided. There were those who felt that their defense of an object, a wonder such as this, was a way to gain recognition. The desire to sacrifice for the Consilium and the wise in service rang true in the ears of many, while others counseled patience, that the knowledge of such a wonder would draw more than just idle attention and curiosity. One of the few orders without strife was the Guardians of the Veil. They sought to protect the sleeping world from the machinations of the Awakened, and their policy was simple: hide what needed hidden, protect the Veil, and protect the Consilium.%0a%3c %0a%3c The final decision, reached a year after the Hallows had appeared and vanished, was made, and knowledge of the wonder was spread to various Consili. In North America an Envoy was sent first to South Carolina, Charleston being the nearest neighboring Consilium, before moving on to Jamestown and eventually Boston. Another envoy was sent to Europe, visiting the Consili of England. The Awakened of Savannah agreed that their work would not be shared with the French or Spanish Consili, some mundane superstitions and national pride still remained. The envoy to the Americas returned in just over a year, their travels brought with them a handful of new Awakened, mostly of the Mysterium and the Silver Ladder, but also returned with the most interesting of attitudes. The Northern Consili had reacted to the story of ''Hattan’s'' wonder with suspicion, with denial that something so grand would be found in the youngest of the Colonies. The Boston Consilium was the worst with,  “an attitude of superiority that was thicker than fresh butter” or so the envoy said. Those who arrived were welcomed, and offered chances to join the Savannah Consilium. Most of them, younger mages, took the opportunity with relish, like indentured servants being offered freedom, the mages agree and set to earning their way in the growing city. %0a%3c %0a%3c A year and a half later the envoy from Europe returned. The skepticism in Europe was even greater than that of Northern American Consili. The Envoy returned with stories of at least one duel, little in the way of support, but a chest of potential information for the budding Athenaeum from a sympathetic Mystagogue. The Silver Ladder hope of prestige was crushed, the Arrow desire for service was quelled and the Mysterium, which had fought long and hard with itself, licked its wounds in silence. The Guardians of the Veil, not yet numerous, stayed consistent with business as usual.  The Consilium grew, the work continued and the calendar was watched. Two times might have been happenstance; a third would be a pattern. In the remaining decade and some years the Awakened continued to grow, continued to work.  The secrecy of ''Hattan'' and the skill of his work eluded many of even the brightest minds researching the wonder. Time moved on, and Savannah believed that its overtures had been forgotten.%0a%3c %0a%3c %0a%3c [%25color=#365776%25[[#top| Back to top]]]%0a%3c %0a%3c [[#PT5]]%0a%3c !!Revolution%0a%3c %0a%3c 1775, and almost to the day, the Hallows once again appeared. Though, this time, there was more in the air than the excitement of another find. Once again the Hallows had appeared during the storm season, the winds and rains announcing the coming of a severe season were not the only terror that hung unseen in the future. The tensions between the Colonies and the parent were building. Those in Savannah knew there was something on the horizon, the Enchanters and those versed in time studied the signs, the omens, and it was on their words that the Consilium acted. The Acanthi saw the coming conflict, they saw the shrouded horsemen who travelled with every army sense time memorial.  Savannah would first fall, and then stand, its blood would run because of the actions of allies, and not of enemies. The Consilium prepared by harvesting the tass, now a little over 100 pawns, in the week the hallows remained. It was the third time this had happened, and the third time that the hallows had appeared in a different square. There was not enough information to predict which square, which ward of Savannah the hallow would appear in, but the timing was set, 15 years.%0a%3c %0a%3c The Mysterium went to looking into why 15 years might be significant. The number held no special weight with the Native American tribes, and there was nothing that seemed to tie it to the old world. The researchers continued, and in a daring move, helped fund the addition of another ward, this time with Mysterium and Sleepwalker workers excavating the ground among side the sleeping workforce. The project was a rush, how much could be done before the impending hostilities began. It was a tough time, there were many of the Wise who wished to counsel the Mayor and the Governor, warning them that there would be a time of violence, but to do so would threaten the secrecy of the Awakened. They instead waited, hiding caches of Tass should they be needed during the coming days.%0a%3c %0a%3c The ward was not finished when the American Revolution began, and within 2 years of the initial blows, Savannah found itself under the guns of the British Army.  3,000 men under the command of Colonel Archibald Campbell, laid siege to the city of Savannah during December of 1778, with Campbell’s army was a small cabal of Awakened, their presence was not a surprise, but their actions were. Campbell routed the Colonial forces and took possession of the city where he then proved to be a cosmopolitan and kind governor. He displayed an urbane method of treatment, allowing people to carry on with their daily lived with little intervention. He did not recruit or try to turn the population back into royal citizens, and would eventually return Savannah to the control of its then Royal Governor, James Wright.%0a%3c %0a%3c Campbell and his army would eventually move north to Aid in the pacification of South Carolina, Charleston especially, leaving a token force behind in Savannah. The city had not fulfilled the prophecy of bloodshed, and the new Cabal of Mages, all of them from England did nothing to change this. The Cabal of the Hidden Seam was a group of Mysterium and Arrows from Newcastle upon Tyne. Four men in all 2 from each order and representing the Moroi and Obrimoi paths, they had heard of the Savannah Envoy to England well after the envoy had returned to America. With time, and some effort, they had studied the information that had been left by the envoy with the Manchester and Edinburgh Consili, and they had decided to come to America to study the wonder. Even though they were part of the “invading” or “occupying” army, they swore an allegiance to the Consilium of Savannah and worked within the British Army to make the occupation a show of force. In all honesty, compared to other American cities, Savannah was spared the worst… for a while.%0a%3c %0a%3c Immediately the new members of the Consili proved that they were not there in name only. The four had copied and transcribed information recorded in the English Athenaeums, storing them in the ghost realm so that they would not be lost to the sea or to an army. They set to work reclaiming and reconstituting the information that they had hidden, adding greatly to the Athenaeum and its existing library. Their work was done in haste, it was only a matter of time before the Americans arrived to reclaim the city. Though the 4 Wise were saddened to learn that they had just missed the Hallows, they were buoyed by the opportunity to study and possibly witness the next advent of ''Hattan’s'' wonder. Stay true to the fifteen year cycle, they would only need to wait for 12 years, 12 years that they had no issue devoting to study. Their exuberance buoyed the Consilium   and all the orders set to creating new Identities for the four awakened so that come the end of hostilities, they could quickly fall into the fold.%0a%3c %0a%3c A year after Savannah fell to the British the American, with French allies, tried to retake the city. These were the nights of blood that the Enchanters saw. The American’s shelled the city, Artillery being used to disrupt the British only served to hammer the citizens and their homes. The assault failed with major casualties for the Americans and French. The Consilium used this time to try and sneak the cabal of British soldiers away from combat and into hiding, listing them among the lost in the combat. Sadly, one of the Arrows did indeed perish, but the three remaining members of the cabal survived and quietly took residence in Savannah as if they had been there all along.%0a%3c %0a%3c Savannah would remain in British hands until 1782 and it would be 8 years until the next advent of the ''Hattan'' Hallows. The Revolutionary war ended, and Savannah rebuilt. The Hallows did indeed return in 1790 and again in 1805, 1820, 1835 and then in 1850. Each year saw the amount of Tass increase, sometimes by just a few pawns, sometimes nearly doubling. A correlation was found, the amount of tass produced by the Hallows was directly proportional to the population. When the population so did the production of Tass, this idea was first thought off in 1820 when an epidemic of Yellow Fever tore through Savannah.   %0a%3c %0a%3c %0a%3c [%25color=#365776%25[[#top| Back to top]]]%0a%3c %0a%3c [[#PT6]]%0a%3c !!Growth%0a%3c %0a%3c Savannah continued to grow along with the rest of the United States. The hard won independence from England gave the new country its various freedoms along with new sets of problems. The first few years were difficult, but slowly a strong nation took shape. From the end of the Revolution and on into the early 1800’s there were times of prosperity, times were the wonder of the still new land amazed its inhabitants. This is not to say there were not problems. A series of wars with the Native Americans; The Creek War of 18131814, the First (181718) and Second (1835184 Seminole War eroded the goodwill that had once existed in Georgia between the settlers and the Native Americans. The War of 1812, again with England had a lasting effect in Georgia, one that would continue to rear its head for years to come.%0a%3c %0a%3c England had occupied Georgia easily during the revolution, and there was great fear that England would do so again in the War of 1812. While defenses were erected they were poorly equipped, maintained, and the communication between them was horrendous. The English Navy, then the most powerful navy the world had seen, had little trouble forming a blockade along the Eastern seaboard of the United States, including Savannah. The English made landfall at Cumberland, South of Savannah and North of what is now Jacksonville. Before the army could move north, the treaty of Ghent had been signed, and the War of 1812 was over, again, the effects would be felt for some time.%0a%3c %0a%3c During the occupation of Cumberland Island the British forces had conducted raids in Southern Georgia, freeing slaves and inciting rebellion against the state. After the war there was a time of turmoil as Georgians looked to quell these rebellions, and in a manner fit only for that time, “recapture their property.” It was a deplorable time, but slavery was far from being abolished, and the human trafficking would continue through the early 1800’s.  More and more legislation, or a Federal level, came into play regarding slavery, legislation that irritated the Southern States who relied so very heavily on slaves in their agrarian industry. It was a time heading for a boiling point, one that again loomed over the horizon.%0a%3c %0a%3c The Slavery issue affected the Consilium and the Wise as well, the first African Awakened in Savannah during the 1840’s. Sadly the racism that was rampant in the mundane world was not absent in the Awakened world. While the Savannah Consilium had accepted Native American Awakened, mostly in the form of Thyrsus and Acanthus members, the Awakening of a Slave caused difficulties the Consilium did not foresee.  The Consilium had to adapt, there was no doubt the woman, now called ''Orixa'', was Awakened, but she was still a slave, a piece of property of another, and the very idea shook the foundation of the Consilium. The debate over what to do with ''Orixa'' raged in the Consilium for a month until finally the order head of the Adamantine Arrow, an aged Adamant Sage known as Onager stepped to the fore of the discussion. Citing that ''Orixa'' already knew what it was like to live in constant conflict, and that she Awakened despite adversity and anyone else’s attempt to stop her, that she would have a home in the Adamantine Arrow, and that anyone who wished to contest his acceptance of this newly Awakened  woman was welcome to send their seconds to formally duel him.%0a%3c %0a%3c Many considered Onager a madman with this act, and Consilium records show that he had no less than three formal duels for his actions, three duels that he won in a fashion that his Obrimos nature could call divine intervention. ''Orixa'' joined the Adamantine Arrow, training first under Onager, but as her power and prowess grew, under her newly accepting family. ''Orixa'' was the first, but she was not the last. The Consilium records were not known to record the race of the Awakened in Savannah, but there was mention of color regarding no less than five members by 1850.  %0a%3c %0a%3c By the 1850’s, the Consilium was more cosmopolitan, at least in their own meetings, while continuing to appear to mundane friends and family as divided on the class distinction caused by race. There were still those who believed that those of color, any color, were inferior, and their attitudes were barely hidden at times, but the will of the Hierarch, and the strength of various members of the Consilium kept these views in check, save for one incident. During the late 1850’s there was a murder in the Consilium, supposedly spurred by an interracial relationship.  Consilium history is thin on evidence of the events, but there was, for the first time in Savannah, an Awakened killed by another Awakened. The names involved were removed from the History, and the event was, quickly covered up.%0a%3c %0a%3c %0a%3c [%25color=#365776%25[[#top| Back to top]]]%0a%3c %0a%3c [[#PT7]]%0a%3c !!Civil War%0a%3c %0a%3c 1850 saw another series of ‘’Hattan'' Hallows appear and the haul was the largest amount of Tass collected yet. Savannah had a population of over 15,000, making it the largest city in Southeastern Georgia. The total population of the State was close to 525,000 and would grow in the next 10 years to over 1 million people.  From 1850 to 1860 the Obrimos of Savannah quietly worked on mapping the ley lines of Savannah, a project that had been started and stopped many times before. By 1860 the map was done, and it was strange in a way that surprised no one. The map showed an almost perfect grid aligned with the construction of the wards in downtown Savannah. From there, spoke appeared to head off, the spokes were strong, thicker in some ways, than the lines connecting the grid in downtown Savannah. It was during this time that another aspect of ''Hattan’s'' project was noticed. None of the ley line spokes; which appeared to head to Charleston, Sc. via Hilton Head, to Macon then on to Atlanta, Ga., and another to Columbia, Ga., none of the spokes returned power to Savannah. The Ley Lines appeared to be one way, and one way only, emanating outwards from the city. The Surprise did not end there, but in 1855, with the expansion of Jacksonville Florida, a new spoke appeared leaving the Southern Tip of the City and heading towards the younger Floridian City. The confirmation that the new line did indeed make it all the way to Jacksonville was establish by 1860, the same year that it was confirmed that the other spokes made their ways to the other cities.%0a%3c %0a%3c While these surprises were positive moment in the lives of the Wise, there were again the Omens of conflict and war. The argument on races, on color, had reached a fever pitch in the Congress. Threats had been made, if a man by the name of Abraham Lincoln ascended to the Presidency, there would be repercussions. The Wise of Savannah were not perfect, they had started, albeit slowly, to accent the Awakened amongst the slave population, but it was still slow to change. The idea of Slavery was abhorrent to many, yet seemed to be accepted based on the color of one’s skin. The Awakened were changing, unlike the sleepers around them, but they had to be careful not to let it show. It was a difficult time, and was about to get worse. The American Civil War began because of the City of Charleston, and among them the wise of Charleston, fired upon Fort Sumter in the Charleston harbor. Secession began, and Georgia would be the fifth of Eleven States to secede from the Union.%0a%3c %0a%3c At first the secession appeared to work, the battles, fought mostly in Virginia and Tennessee, were far enough away that one could almost believe there was not fighting going on. The war took its toll, and one year became five, a blockade once again stifled commerce, and the population dwindled as men went off to never return. Then, in 1864, the unthinkable happened. William Tecumseh Sherman took Control of Atlanta Georgia in September of 1864, and breaking with tradition, did not collect his forces and move towards a secure port for provisions. Instead, he began his “March to the Sea,” heading toward the Atlantic. Most of Georgia did not know his true intentions, but the Wise of Savannah did, the end of the march would bring Sherman to Savannah. Sherman waged a war unlike any seen before him, a new concept known as Total War, nothing escaped the sword where he went and the Wise were aware of this.%0a%3c %0a%3c The Awakened were also aware that there were no few number of Northern Awakened travelling with Sherman’s Army. While some of the Awakened were bound to be from Consili in the North, the Wise in Savannah felt there would also be those who did not follow the ways of the Diamond orders. A sacking was in the making, but the problem, for the wise of Savannah, was that there was nothing left to sack. ''Hattan’s'' Hallows would not appear for another year and they most certainly did not want an occupying army in the city when that happened. By November Sherman was drawing near and something had to be done.%0a%3c %0a%3c It was two Awakened of the Mysterium, an Obrimos, ''Flare'', and a Moros, ''Locust'', who proposed a solution. Both had studied the wonder left by ''Hattan'' since their acceptance into the Mysterium. ''Flare'' had been one of the many Obrimos who had studied the ley lines and their odd conveyance of energy and ''Locust'' had tried to relearn the ancient prime focused earth-sculpting that ''Hattan'' had mastered. It was their thought that the device left by ''Hattan'' could be “turned off” for a limited amount of time. That the wonder could be diverted so that hallows did not appear, potentially strengthening the ley lines to other cities, but reducing the creation of tass in Savannah, thus hiding the true wonder from an Invading army. With the Hierarch’s blessing they began to work. %0a%3c %0a%3c ''Flare'' made notes on everything that he and ''Locust'' did. Rumor has it they forged rods of adamantine imbued with prime, rods said to be “three times the height of a man and as thick around as an arm… .” It took time. They were hurried, but they did not rush. The rods were to act like pins inside a lock, each one set at a different spot, a different depth. The rods, once set in place, would be hidden from mage sight, their threads cut so that no one mage could remove them without knowing where they were placed. The work was complete during the last days of November 1864, Sherman’s army was near the periphery of Savannah. The Awakened of Savannah prepared a delegation to ride out and meet with the approaching Wise. As the delegation left ''Flare'' and ''Locust'' went to work, placing the rods inside the nodes, the pattern kept secret only to be passed along to the Hierarch themselves. %0a%3c %0a%3c The delegation of Southern awakened was welcomed by their Northern counterparts. Conversation was cordial, concern about their health and the strength of the Consilium seemed to be the first topic of Conversation. There was no mention about ''Hattan’s'' at first, instead, business was done the old way, the, surprisingly, Southern way. At the mention of the wonder it was one of the Northern Awakened who answered the hanging question. The Northern Wise were there to help the Consilium of Savannah protect the wonder. Auguries and precognitions in the North had omens of a great wonder, hidden in the lands of the wayward sleepers that would come under attack from within. Since Savannah was the only city with such a wonder, and since earlier communication had never been responded to, the Consili had drafted men from the Western Consili to try and make it to Savannah.%0a%3c %0a%3c The Southern Awakened were shocked, they denied having ever received an inquiry or a message regarding this dire event. A panic took over the collected wise and the members from the Savannah Consilium, with an escort from the Northern Wise, returned to Savannah with all haste. There they found that events had transpired worse than they could imagine. ''Locust'' was dead, left murdered in Liberty Square. Of ''Flare'', there was no word. The research that went along with the project, the location of the adamantine rods, everything had been taken or destroyed. The Athenaeum had been attacked, parts of the building smoldered from arcane blasts, the inside held strong, but there was no way those inside could have known what was going on. The deed had been done, there were too many questions, not enough answers.%0a%3c %0a%3c Savannah surrendered to Sherman December of 1864, Sherman, like Campbell before him, was charitable towards the citizens of Savannah, he did as he promised, and showed Mercy, leaving the city intact. Within a Month he was gone, marching into South Carolina on his continued campaign. Among those he left behind were the dozen or so Awakened from the North. With their help, a manhunt began. The trail left by ''Flare'', was obscured, but was not impossible to track. During this search many things came to light. ''Flare'' had been a Seer, originally from the South he was Northern educated, more time and more resources were spent tracking this lone mage down. The next year, 1865, during the appointed month, the Hallows did not appear. The sorrow was equaled in anger, the despair matched with rage. The Consilium of Savannah, as a whole, declared Nemesis on the Awakened Seer known as ''Flare'', and sent this declaration to all surviving established Consili in both the North and the South. The Civil War ended, but a hidden war was just being born.%0a%3c %0a%3c 1865 passed, as did 1880, and then 1895, the third cycle was again missed, the Hallows didn’t appear, but there was a conclusion to the story started 31 years prior. ''Flare'' was eventually found in Chicago in 1895. In the 30 years he had been on the lamb, members of the Savannah Consilium had destroyed no less than 15 pylons and disrupted multiple tetrarchies in their pursuit of this one mage. Some of the lost work had been recovered, or copies of the notes made about the project, were occasionally acquired, but ''Flare'' had escaped notice. ''Flare'' had been bartering knowledge for protection and power, but it did nothing to protect him from a wrath of a city. Members of the Savannah Adamantine Arrow cornered ''Flare'' in Rockford Park, Chicago, and forced him to combat. ''Flare'' died in December 1895, taking with him most of the information he had stolen to his grave. That would seem to be sad, but fitting end, to the Seer who had committed such an act against the Consilium of Savannah, but it was not the end. Two Mysterium Moros were with the arrow at ''Flare’s''’ demise, the chained and bound his soul, brought him back the Athenaeum, and proceeded to strip the information from his remaining mind before finally destroying him. It was not one of the better moments for the Mysterium, but it brought closure to a dark Chapter in the history of the city.%0a%3c %0a%3c %0a%3c [%25color=#365776%25[[#top| Back to top]]]%0a%3c %0a%3c [[#PT8]]%0a%3c !!The Free Council%0a%3c %0a%3c The Reconstruction was hard on the South, especially in Georgia where Sherman had taken life by the throat, shaken it repeatedly and thrown it on the ground. Savannah had escaped the physical violence that Atlanta, Columbia and other cities had experience, but the psychological damage was still there. A way of life had been shattered, and to make the recovery more complex, there were those in the North who took advantage of the situation. Charleston was the premier port on the Eastern seaboard but Savannah still made major contributions in foodstuffs, and of course, cotton.%0a%3c %0a%3c The loss of the Hallows changed the Consilium in some ways, the Mysterium became focused on recovering the information stolen and destroyed by ''Flare''. Of the five rods sank into the nodes 2 had been found, and they still remained. Somehow the rods had bonded with the nodes, becoming hard to distinguish between the two. There was no idea on how to separate them, and if ''Flare'' did know, not even his ghost gave up that information. The Consilium developed an entire section of their Athenaeum to the study of the wonder. They became withdrawn for some time, the object of their studies had been sullied under their noses and they grew despondent after ''Flare'' was destroyed. The hopes of regaining some of the lost knowledge had buoyed them, and the drop from hope was felt by the entire order. The Silver Ladder worked hard to hold things together, to try and stave off the melancholy caused by rebuilding. The Guardians of the Veil and the Arrows, both having been on war footing for so long, took time to acclimate back into society. It was a difficult era, a time of confusion and questions.%0a%3c %0a%3c Odd that this occurred during the same time as the birth of the Free Council, a time during the refusal, when so many Wise were disillusioned with the old way, looking for something new, something that they could hold on to. The Birth of Free Council was keenly felt in Savannah, many decided that the old ways were not for them, had cost them too much. The apostasy to join this fledgling order hit the Mysterium the hardest, followed closely by the Arrow and even some Ladders and Guardians felt the need to change. In other cities, where there was bloodshed and violence, there was a malaise that was hanging over Savannah, one that took the wind out of sails. The Free Council was not exactly accepted, but it was barely fought. For once apathy successfully stopped violence and bloodshed, but the spiral the Consilium and the Wise were in was not healthy. For close to 40 years the Consilium had been at war, the loss of an enemy was also a loss of identity as they had used resource after resource to chase after ''Flare''. They needed to regroup, and it was the Seers who once again provided them with the opportunity.%0a%3c %0a%3c It was the most mundane thing really, the Boll Weevil, a form of beetle that seemed unassuming, yet was incredibly destructive, was the enemy. In 1915 small infestations begin to appear in Savannah’s cotton farms. By 1920 it is epidemic proportions. At first the Thyrsus Silver Ladder and the Mysterium sought to contain the Weevil’s using life magic, but it was apparent that this was something more than just an infestation. It was the members of the Free Council, looking for answers outside of nature and the overt, that saw the hands of the Seers of the Throne involved with the Weevil infestation. Once again the Seers were attacking Savannah, trying to destroy its use to the Diamond, now Pentacle orders. The Free Council became the vanguard in the fight not only against the insect infestation, but against the Seers themselves. This dedication to the other Awakened gave rise to the spirits of the Consilium members, once again they had a common purpose, and again they were united. %0a%3c %0a%3c The Destruction of crops was rampant, but once again Savannah survived. The Consilium had been taxed heavily, but it too survived. The Free Council was accepted, faster than many other Consili had accepted the upstart order. Savannah would continue on.%0a%3c %0a%3c The ''Hattan'' Hallows did not appear in 1910, nor in 1925 or 1940. By 1940 the Consilium was strong again and the population of Savannah had grown to almost 100,000 people and the Consilium had grown to match. A new conflict was waiting in the wings, one that would take place far away from Savannah, but a conflict that would still have an effect on the city. War spread across Europe, and the Consilium prepared to send aid to its one time parent Consili in England. Since 1860 Savannah had spent more than 40 years in one form of conflict or another. They had experience in survival, in fortitude, and they could feel, even without arcana, the weight that was pressing against Europe. %0a%3c %0a%3c %0a%3c [%25color=#365776%25[[#top| Back to top]]]%0a%3c %0a%3c [[#PT9]]%0a%3c !!The Sacking of the Athenaeum%0a%3c %0a%3c World Wars I and II passed, and then there was Korea. The fighting was abroad, Vietnam was beginning to build, and the effect was felt stateside in a variety of ways. There was constant conflict yet none of it at home, at least, nothing like the battlefields in Europe and Asia. A different war was brewing at home, Civil Rights, the age old question of color taken to a national level by the likes of Rosa Parks, Martin Luther King Jr., and Malcolm X rocked the nation with act of civil disobedience and speeches. The nation felt the stamp of a million feet, Georgia did not escape this time of change, nor did Savannah.%0a%3c %0a%3c While Atlanta took a spotlight with marches and protests, Savannah quietly persevered. The work done in the 1800’s by the Consilium had done much for equal right among the awakened, and now the mortal population was keeping up. The Consilium used their magic, carefully, to smooth out tensions, to ease the people into a future. Massive works of mind and life, fate and time, were cast around the city, the Consilium did not want Savannah to see another siege, this time from within. By 1940 Savannah’s population was over 50%25 black or of mixed race, one of the largest percentages in America, The Consilium saw the writing on the wall, the transition to a new day was smoother than in other cities, some hatreds and fear could never be defeated, but that was not Savannah’s problem.%0a%3c %0a%3c The Hallows did not return in 1940, nor did they return in 1955. For a while there was hope, the nodes seemed to grow stronger with the increase in population, the Ley Lines pulsed with an amazing brilliance and Prime users found ways to siphon off some of the residual energy. It was during this time that the modern day Savannah Athenaeum was founded. The building that still houses the Mysterium’s grand library was built, and during one quiet night, over half of its power supply was converted from electricity to energy from a nearby node. It was a grand time, the lore recovered from chasing ''Flare'' added with the nearly 300 years of history and study, made the Savannah Athenaeum one of the great treasures of the Southeast. The subject were many, Ghost and spirits, native American occult, the ''Hattan'' Project, the Weevil wars, Southern Cooking and even a section on the Seers. What made the library special was not the ''Hattan'' information, but a section dedicated entirely to omens, oracles and auguries that had been recorded since the founding of the City. Sometimes these portents were not understood until the event was happen, the predictions were many and varied; often esoteric or hidden in gibberish. Some of the records were never understood, and the members of the Mysterium did not know if that was because the events they describe had not taken place, or the translation was just wrong.%0a%3c %0a%3c Despite the racial tensions, the Consilium was strong. It had weathered many storms, and it had persevered and continued to grow. Not as large as Charleston or Atlanta, and spared the ravage of the Civil War and Sherman’s march, Savannah was a bastion of the Old South. For some time there truly was peace in the city, which made the events in 1962 even more shocking.%0a%3c %0a%3c In what could only be called a fit of madness an Awakened Mage  studying in the Athenaeum set fire to the room containing the oracles as well as much of the information on ''Hattan’s'' wonder. This was the second time the pages of information were lost, and this time, due to the Awakeneds' knowledge of death, they truly were lost. Members of the Mysterium tried to subdue the Magi; two died in the attempt and one more never regained their sanity. The used of mastery levels of time and fate was awesome to behold, terrifying yet awesome, and the remaining Mystagogue had a choice; save their Athenaeum or fight the magus. They chose to save their works and the Wise, whose name has been lost to time, with threads and fate hiding them away from others, fled. %0a%3c %0a%3c The magus took nothing with them, at least that is what was thought. There is strong suspicion that “the Eternal Now” or a variant was used. Many conflicting thoughts and memories of the event remained. No two stories seemed to add up, and when the Mysterium looked through its ranks, no one could remember enough to identify the mage who performed this act. What was known was this was not an attack by the Seers of the Throne, this was not a theft. The magus, male or female was never agreed on, vanished, leaving nothing behind and taking nothing, to the knowledge of curators, with them. Instead they left ash and death, there was no vengeance like there was on ''Flare'', to be had. The Mysterium licked its wounds, saved what it could, and put safeguards in play that would never allow this event to happen again.%0a%3c %0a%3c %0a%3c [%25color=#365776%25[[#top| Back to top]]]%0a%3c %0a%3c [[#PT10]]%0a%3c !!Turn of the Century%0a%3c %0a%3c Savannah grew quiet for many years, the city continued to grow, out shadowed by Atlanta as Georgia’s premier city. Atlanta was the capital, the switch had occurred over 100 years ago, and Savannah seemed to move along just a little slows after the transition. By the latter half of the 20th century Savannah had become the fourth largest city behind Atlanta, Augusta and Columbia. If there was a depreciation in prestige it was not felt, Savannah was still the first city of Georgia, and in many ways, its jewel. The Athenaeum rebuilt, the Consilium grew, and the city, in many ways was thriving.%0a%3c %0a%3c Sadly, the actions taken by the Consilium in pursuing ''Flare'' after the Civil War had earned it animosity outside of the normal antagonism between the Pentacle and the Seers of the Throne. The early 1980’s saw a refusal war for the city conducted between the Adamantine Arrows and the Guardians of the Veil against the Seers of the Throne. Casualties mounted, the Adamantine Arrow taking the brunt of the damage. By the mid-nineties the Arrow was spent, achieving a hollow victory in holding the city with their order shattered. It was at this time that the future Adamant Sage ''Kreig'' appeared in Savannah. Through sheer force of will he rebuilt and reformed the Arrow. The Guardians had fared better, but their shadow war with the Seers continued. %0a%3c %0a%3c The final act of the refusal war was the refurbishing of Coastal State Prison, a Federal Correctional institution that the Seers entrenched themselves in. A peace, if you would call it that, was called, though neither side ever completely gave up on the eternal war between the dogmatic factions. The Arrows rebuilt and restructured, ''Kreig’s'' methods were efficient and the Seers retreated behind the walls of bureaucracy.  A watchful peace was still a peace, and the Consilium continued to grow.%0a%3c %0a%3c In the late nineties ''Titus'' of the Silver Ladder ascended to the Hierarch, and for a while there was a “Golden Age” for the Consilium. After so many struggles, after years of conflict, both mundane and supernal, the city seemed at peace. The enemy was near, but they were known. The works of the Mysterium flourished, the Free Council created changed, the Guardians of the Veil hid the works of the wise from the mundane world, the Adamantine Arrow waited, ready to defend, and the Silver Ladder lead by example. For the moment the Consilium was stable, strong, and in league with one another to make the city a better place for Wise and sleeper alike.%0a%3c %0a%3c The calm was enjoyed by many, the peace a treat after so many years of struggle and adversity. The hallows had not returned and for a moment that was not a worry. Many dedicated themselves to the study of the ancient wonder, Mysterium mages found able and willing helpers from the other orders in trying to unravel the work of ''Flare''. For some, worry set in, it is always calm before a storm, and while many wished to forget, some would not.%0a%3c %0a%3c %0a%3c [%25color=#365776%25[[#top| Back to top]]]%0a%3c %0a%3c [[#PT11]]%0a%3c !!Modern Nights%0a%3c %0a%3c Coming Soon%0a%3c %0a%3c [%25color=#365776%25[[#top| Back to top]]]%0a%3c %0a%3c (:include CityBook.MageNavigationBar:)%0a\ No newline at end of file%0a
