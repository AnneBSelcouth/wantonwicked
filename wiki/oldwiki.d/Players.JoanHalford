Strikingly tall, decidedly dark in fashion, definitely gorgeous in rugged style and notably buxom, she regularly squeezes her curves into slinky ensembles made of equal parts denim, leather, and lace. Her hair is a wild black tangle that falls loose to her hips and seems to dare a comb to come near it, and that same defiance burns bright in her dark, piercing eyes. She’s often painted up a bit garishly, but her adornments otherwise tend to the simple and punkish, chosen more for flash than value in a crass stab at materialism.'' %0a%0a''When her fae '''''Mien''''' is witnessed the changes might seem subtle if one could look past the blazing power it displays; save for slightly-pointed ears, pale skin, and blazing red eyes she looks more or less human – if humans had a presence measured in megatons. A dull, fiery radiance glows in her throat and chest, growing in intensity as her passions rise and escaping in radiant beams when she raises her voice loudly. Fae ears perpetually hear the distant sound of riffing guitar and thundering percussion on the edge of their consciousness in her presence.''%0a%0a''The '''''Mantle''''' of Summer burns hot and deep about her, leaving her skin radiating with the sheen of sweet summer sweat and her feet occasionally wreathed in the haze of warm and smoky fog; her hair and clothes rustle with the balmy caress of a midsummer night breeze.'' %0a%0a''Yet despite all of this, it is her voice that is most striking and memorable; thick with power, promise, and smoky passion, her ballads can break a heart and her calls to arms can inflame one to rival the sun in its fire. Peculiarly, she claims to be a Savannah native but possesses a quasi-British accent and her dialect shows heavy influences likewise. If asked about this by fae inquisitors she rolls her ruby-red eyes and chalks it up to her "Holiday in Arcadia"; most mortals seem to chalk it up to a stage persona and give it no further thought, some faint element of her Mask at work.'' %0a %0a[[%3c%3c]]%0ahttp://wantonwicked.gamingsandbox.com/wiki/images/ctl/headers/ctl_h.png%0a''Roughly three years ago the formerly-unknown band '''''Chimericana''''' emerged from obscurity to begin gathering cult fame locally, fronted by the bombastic, buxom, barbaric heavy metal queen going by the monniker '''''Joan Halford''''' ''(no relation, she insists)'' in their crusade against wealth, privilege, and societal injustice. Loud, charismatic, and possessing a profound skill with both her axe and her pipes, the heavy metal heroine and her motley band of miscreants has taken the local metal scene by storm, and their hard-rocking mix of punk and power metal has earned them a devoted a growing fanbase with its scathing condemnation of the "chimerical lie that has been made of the American Dream."''%0a[[%3c%3c]]%0a%0ahttp://wantonwicked.gamingsandbox.com/wiki/images/ctl/headers/ctl_rph.png%0a%0a'''''Rock'N'Roll Rebel''''' (''Any''): Far from some distant celebrity endorser, Joan's often found down in the trenches lending her notable charm and modest fame to various causes and demonstrations, particularly those directed against 'societal inequality.'

With a sound that has been described as an energetic fusion of punk anger and epic power metal with a few hints of classic southern rock for good measure, their voice is decidedly their own, and the group has begun recieving steady air-time on various stations, this bolstered by a highly-successful recent tour.%0a%0a'''''I Can Quit Anytime I Want''''' (''Lost''): Joan's titanic appetite for booze is no secret amongst the public, but any of the Lost dealing with her will soon realize the Fairest has a near-addiction to Glamour, and perhaps more specifically the harvesting thereof.
