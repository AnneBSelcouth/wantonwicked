Partying like a rockstar, sledgehammer in hand. When the Soviet Union collapsed, he was in Kazakhstan making friends with dignitaries and cutting deals for small arms. When rebel factions in Sierra Leone fought against the regime of the day he was there too. Adding fuel to the fire by selling them weapons in exchange for diamonds mined by slave labor. When the bank crisis hit America in 2008, he was in Wall Street quietly making a small fortune. Europe, Africa, the Americas. Ask him how he always manages to be at the right place at the right time and he'll tell you he's just lucky. Some people say he's just lying about his past. Still others call him an agent of chaos, a ruthless and morally bankrupt man who delights in exploiting other peoples misery. Whatever the truth is, whenever a crisis or turning point befalls a region he's there. %0a%0a%25color=#9c9c9c%25Which begs the question. Why did he come here?
