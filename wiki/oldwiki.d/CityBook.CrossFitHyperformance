A huge fan is blowing from the back to attempt to cool the atmosphere. The cement floor is covered in rubber pads to prevent dropped weights from damaging the floor. On the left side of the building the squad racks are there for lifting, with pull up racks and jacobs ladders in the back. From the ceiling, the American Flag and other flags representing memorabilia, such as military Units, and other Crossfit affiliates hang.  Near the large wall fan, there is a small smoothie bar, that is manned by the staff. The gym is usually pretty well occupied, even though no group classes are being right now. There are a few of the coaches out conducting individual sessions on the floor. The gym smells of hard work and body odor. The work outs of the day, with best times are written on a large white board handing by the front desk. The front desk is to the left of the main entrance, while the locker rooms exist on the other side of the building.
