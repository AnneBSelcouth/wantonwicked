A mass of dark hair and deep tanned body that alluded to constant burns and blisters.  Wild eyes that were more animal than man.  His wardrobe was drab, military colors and utilitarian in nature.  The only jewelry he wore were dogtags and ear plug cases.  That hasn't been the case for over a decade now.%25%25%0a%0a%25color=#9e0b0f%25Like any Dynamic Predator, Devon changes his appearance to match his environment.  When he feeds, he wears the camouflage of his surroundings, when he plays, it is peacock feathers to attract playmates.  Are any of us really so different?%25%25  %0a%0a%25color=#9e0b0f%25Today, Devon is rarely seen outside of couture.  Watches that cost what a family may spend on their car, and suits that start in the four digits.  Ruggedly handsome, manicured, coiffed and groomed, those that once new the man could hardly pick him out of a line up.  That is exactly how he likes it as well.%25%25%0a%0a%25color=#9e0b0f%25The other side of his world is spent closer to his origins.  He can be found moving among the warehouses and docks of the import export world wearing his aviators and his hard canvas pants.  Hard gloves and work boots, replace his french cuffs and Italian shoes.  The joys of being a fun raiser, come with the cost of spending that money on the cause.  Causes that often require him to move among the less fortunate, and more sever.%25%25%0a[[%3c%3c]]%0a%0a%25%25http://wantonwicked.gamingsandbox.com/wiki/images/vtr/headers/vtr_h.png%0a%25lfloat text-align=center margin-top=5px margin-right=15px margin-bottom=5px margin-left=0px width=350 newwin%25http://1.bp.blogspot.com/-c53D9X8Y6G4/TvEilE7-61I/AAAAAAAABlg/5L83ukzcIi4/s1600/adrien_brody_i_by_badraggled.jpg%0a%25color=#9e0b0f%25Devon first arrived in Georgia almost a decade ago.  He was just one more Nationalized citizen disappearing in the mix of bland and pointless living.  He never enjoyed it and chaffed at the swollen ignorance of the suburbs.  A number of drunk tank visits, vandalism, and disorderly pick ups only lead more and more of his neighbors to label him a bad element. To counter this, Devon sold his house and moved to Atalanta.  %0a%0a%25color=#9e0b0f%25Once in Atlanta, Devon's poor behavior worked for him, and he quickly found his way into the nightclub scene and the aggressive young turk crowd.  Fearless and easily aggravated, that is the mix that pushed him up the chain until there were pictures of him in local hot lists and "Who's Who" in Hotlanta rags.  It was fun, if not incredibly stupid.  Entrepreneur, import, export, investment, whatever.  It was only about the money and never about the job.%0a%0a%25color=#9e0b0f%25Devon's sire found him not long after.  She had no issue identifying him for who he really was, and as always happens, young Devon's past caught up to him.  The embrace was not pleasant, and the following struggle for control was even worse.  Instead of a Wolf amongst the Sheep, poor Devon found himself an Omega being trained by a Tyrannosaurus. Like riding a bike, he couldn't forget where he came from, and She quickly got him back on track.  Only this time, he was not the warrior he wished to be, but the officer he ran from.%0a  %0a%0a%25%25http://wantonwicked.gamingsandbox.com/wiki/images/vtr/headers/vtr_rph.png%0a%0a%25color=#9e0b0f%25'''[[http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=T9Op2YQ7yyU |Fun Raising!]] ''' (New Money):%25%25 Are you young, mildly political, and moderately successful?  Do you believe that if given the chance you would be the perfect hip hop, or rock star?  Well look no further, because Devon often throws fund raisers for various international political groups that are little more than raves, mixed with limo jousting, mixed with swingers parties.  Maybe you have been to one, or maybe you wished you had.%25%25%0a%0a%25color=#9e0b0f%25'''[[http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eUPxgigVgWc|Eligible Bachelor]]''' (Anyone):%25%25 Known to cruise from one model or minor celebrity to the next, Devon has always profited from his relationship, as have his partners.  Are you in need of some minor fame, or just a guest to an event?  Devon is more than capable of making sure you are remembered, while engaging his own agenda without your help.%0a%0a%25color=#9e0b0f%25'''[[http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=a1MEA_TyL2M|Right of Right]]'''(Politics):%25%25 Outspoken about his disdain for charity, and his views on enabling the irresponsible and poor, Devon is seen as an extreme right winger in his economic and security views.  He has, on occasion, made tea party and life long Republicans, uncomfortable with his rhetoric.%0a%0a%25color=#9e0b0f%25 '''[[http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XG8k4IYIgvo|Carthian Devil]]''' (Kindred):%25%25 When I was a child... Devon has finally given into his Sire's wishes and formally become a leading citizen within the Movement.  However, the blood still boils for a good argument, and he is known to champion other covenants occasionally, perhaps just to argue.%0a%0a%25color=#9e0b0f%25 '''[[http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oiXaT_1I-vw|Things Men Do...]]''' (Hobbies):%25%25 Devon has a very conservative idea of what a man "should" be able to do.  He regularly goes to gun ranges, gyms, martial arts classes, and poker games.  He engages in car shows, fishing trips, and sports events.  Men's men are welcome, but check your purse at the door, brau.%0a%0a[[%3c%3c]]%0a%25%25http://wantonwicked.gamingsandbox.com/wiki/images/vtr/headers/vtr_con.png%0a%25lfloat width=70px%25http://i10.photobucket.com/albums/a110/JustineNuara/ClaraPhizer_zpsc9edcaae.jpg%0a[[http://wantonwicked.gamingsandbox.com/wiki/index.php?n=Players.ClaraPhizer|Clara Phizer ]]  Clara Phizer is the sire that choose to take Devon into the Succubi and is herself a bit of a violent and outspoken voice among the Carthians.  She does not dote over Devon, though she if found of letting his rants reach a certain point before smashing him down.

The epic debates that have errupted between the two over the virtues of a particular weapon, manufacturer, bow vs rifle, hunting club, etc.  has even run off some of the more fanatic members.  While it all seems good natured between the pair, their have been weeks when the fallout has left the two giving one another the silent treatment.%0a%0a%0a%25lfloat width=70px%25http://imageshack.com/scaled/800x600/405/e82f.jpg %0a[[Gideon Ward|Gideon Ward ]] Though only formally introduced within the last few years, these two Carthians have began to be seen more and more in polite conversation.  Upon meeting, they were both pleased to see they frequented some of the same hunt clubs and sporting events in Atlanta, while also finding common ground in political arenas.  Some assume that Devon is attempting to court Gideon as a mentor, while many of the younger Carthians distrust how easily Gideon has influenced Devon.%0a%0a[[%3c%3c]]%0a%25%25http://wantonwicked.gamingsandbox.com/wiki/images/vtr/headers/vtr_q.png%0a%0a'''Feel Free to Add your own'''%0a%0a''It is better to be violent, if there is violence in our hearts, than to put on the cloak of nonviolence to cover impotence.'' - '''Mahatma Gandhi'''%0a%0a''In matters of conscience, the law of the majority has no place.'' - '''Mahatma Gandhi'''%0a%0a"Smokin' is a filthy habit, I know.

The epic debates that have errupted between the two over the virtues of a particular weapon, manufacturer, bow vs rifle, hunting club, etc.  has even run off some of the more fanatic members.  While it all seems good natured between the pair, their have been weeks when the fallout has left the two giving one another the silent treatment.%0a

He was just one more Nationalized citizen disappearing in the mix of bland and pointless living.  He never enjoyed it and chaffed at the swollen ignorance of the suburbs.  A number of drunk tank visits, vandalism, and disorderly pick ups only lead more and more of his neighbors to label him a bad element. To counter this, Devon sold his house and moved to Atalanta.  %0a%3c %0a%3c %25color=#9e0b0f%25Once in Atlanta, Devon's poor behavior worked for him, and he quickly found his way into the nightclub scene and the aggressive young turk crowd.  Fearless and easily aggravated, that is the mix that pushed him up the chain until there were pictures of him in local hot lists and "Who's Who" in Hotlanta rags.  It was fun, if not incredibly stupid.  Entrepreneur, import, export, investment, whatever.  It was only about the money and never about the job.%0a%3c %0a%3c %25color=#9e0b0f%25Devon's sire found him not long after.  She had no issue identifying him for who he really was, and as always happens, young Devon's past caught up to him.  The embrace was not pleasant, and the following struggle for control was even worse.  Instead of a Wolf amongst the Sheep, poor Devon found himself an Omega being trained by a Tyrannosaurus. Like riding a bike, he couldn't forget where he came from, and She quickly got him back on track.

Sadly, that didn't last to long, as she was cited to be unsuited for the ''Visus Draconis'', and after a period of apostasy where she descended to live on the streets and suffered some sort of mental breakdown, she was eventually found and trained by a Silver Ladder of the Geechee community by the river lowlands.

A mass of dark hair and deep tanned body that alluded to constant burns and blisters.  Wild eyes that were more animal than man.  His wardrobe was drab, military colors and utilitarian in nature.

That hasn't been the case for over a decade now.%25%25%0a%3c %0a%3c %25color=#9e0b0f%25Like any Dynamic Predator, Devon changes his appearance to match his environment.

Watches that cost what a family may spend on their car, and suits that start in the four digits.

That is exactly how he likes it as well.%25%25%0a%3c %0a%3c %25color=#9e0b0f%25The other side of his world is spent closer to his origins.  He can be found moving among the warehouses and docks of the import export world wearing his aviators and his hard canvas pants.  Hard gloves and work boots, replace his french cuffs and Italian shoes.  The joys of being a fun raiser, come with the cost of spending that money on the cause.

Her bust is generous, her skin is fair, and head is held tall with pride.%25%25%0a%3c %0a%3c %25color=#004a80%25The slight curl of her locks ends about halfway down her back, most days. She styles it as fits the situation of course; braids and buns, barrettes and elastic bands - but she has a preference for letting it run free, to frame her face; high cheekbones and plus lips. A straight nose and wide, steel-grey eyes able to bring up a bright intensity to their gaze.%25%25%0a%3c %0a%3c %25color=#004a80%25While she likewise dresses for the occassion; from formal robes to little black dresses. From rags to riches and back again. Even in her daily life, her wardrobe is eclectic; spanning from summer dresses to yoga pants, whirling past blouses and slacks and into jeans and t-shirts. The generalities that can be made is that she seems to have a hankering for vibrant colours, and she puts some pride in fair trade and quality-wear.%25%25%0a---%0a> (:tableend:)%0a43a38,39%0a> %25%25http://wantonwicked.gamingsandbox.com/wiki/images/vtr/headers/vtr_d.png%0a> What the character Looks like, please replace%0a46,48c42,44%0a%3c %25lfloat text-align=center margin-top=5px margin-right=15px margin-bottom=5px margin-left=0px width=350 newwin%25http://forceoperationsx.webs.com/mgs-sketch05-liquid.gif%0a%3c %25color=#004a80%25When Bethel first showed up, about three years ago, they called her %25color=#33CCCC%25Robin%25color=#004a80%25, and she was apprenticed to the Guardians of the Veil. Sadly, that didn't last to long, as she was cited to be unsuited for the ''Visus Draconis'', and after a period of apostasy where she descended to live on the streets and suffered some sort of mental breakdown, she was eventually found and trained by a Silver Ladder of the Geechee community by the river lowlands. In time, she was initiated into the Order, and recently returned to the Consilium proper, studying under [[Players.Alsace|Alsace]] and preparing for her factotum exams.%0a%3c %0a---%0a> What the sheep see, verse what is real%0a> [[%3c%3c]]%0a> %25rfloat text-align=center margin-top=5px margin-right=0px margin-bottom=5px margin-left=15px width=300%25http://th04.deviantart.net/fs71/200H/i/2012/101/4/9/liquid_snake_by_randall500-d4vrzd0.jpg| '''Polizie Sketches of the Suspect'''%0a50,59c46,56%0a%3c %0a%3c %25width=25%25http://wantonwicked.gamingsandbox.com/wiki/images/mta/symbols/mta_logo_gov.png '''%25newwin%25[[https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KQ6zr6kCPj8| %25color=#004a80%25Bro, Do You Even Veil?]]''' (Guardians): %25color=#33CCCC%25Back when ''Bethel'' was ''Robin'', she hung with the cool kids in town.
