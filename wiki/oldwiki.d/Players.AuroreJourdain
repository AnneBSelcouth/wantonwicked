Her energy level is best described as high voltage and her personality rings of youth and innocence and naivety. Of course she's quite charming in her own way, but some may regard her as someone that is completely incompetent or maybe even a bit vapid. Well, that is until one gets to know her.\\%0aThe features of her sweetly arresting face are both dulcet and youthful and among her most notable features are her sweet pink cherub lips, porcelain skin, and wide innocent green eyes. Usually, she can be found wearing an expression of wonder along with jeans and favorite pink t-shirt with an over-apron, or maybe even tights and a tutu. Really, it's entirely dependent upon her mood. Regardless, she's never entirely clean. Sometimes her hands are sticky with icing or there is dirt from gardening upon her jeans or under her nails.%0a(:cell:) http://i1132.photobucket.com/albums/m568/landsasunder/auroreright1_zpsf154d033.png%0a(:tableend:)%0a(:table border=0 cellpadding=5 cellspacing=0:)%0a(:cellnr align=left:)%0ahttp://i1132.photobucket.com/albums/m568/landsasunder/mien_zps5c5aca61.png \\%0aWhen her mien is manifest she has a crown of flowers upon her head that are reminiscent of Mucha's art nouveau paintings. Her eyelashes become that of the purple and green tendrils of the passion flower, and there's a thick floral fragrance that hangs in the air. Tiny hummingbirds, bumblebees, and little glass butterflies constantly buzz around her head - nuisances, all of them! - and occasionally she has been known to swat at them. Lastly, where her feet or hands touch the ground or anything organic various tiny flowering plants grow and wither with her passing.%0a(:cell:) http://i1132.photobucket.com/albums/m568/landsasunder/auroreright4_zps040038e1.png%0a(:tableend:)%0a[[%3c%3c]]%0a(:tableend:)%0a(:table border=0 cellpadding=5 cellspacing=0:)%0a(:cellnr align=left width=275:)%0ahttp://i1132.photobucket.com/albums/m568/landsasunder/history_zpse80b0323.png%0aAurore was a prized garden flower in the vast Royal Gardens of the Toad Prince Yoric of the Vale during her stay on 'the other side'.

The entrance is quite a ways away from it and one must follow a winding path of stones amidst a meadow of lotus pads and flowers upon the surface of the stagnant water, only to arrive at the fungus steps that lead up to the front door.\\%0aThe cottage that sits at the base of the tree doesn't appear to have been built around the tree, but is rather part of it with gnarled vines climbing along the tree's texture to give way to large windows when needed. Not only does it appear to be multi-story if one were to count layers of windows, but there also seems to be - at the very top! - a large glass dome with crystalline frosted glass. \\%0aOut the back, there's a balcony over-looking the water that's naturally draped in Spanish moss for privacy and hidden in the top most canopy of the tree, a chimney can be found. The place reeks of coziness and homeyness. Obviously someone cares a great deal for this place.\\%0aHanging from almost all branches, lengths of chain support a series of delicate bird houses and each length is capped off with a lantern.

"Well because that's what he just left on your shoulder."'' Actually, it's Sir Gauvain Emrys Leodeagan Maraunt McNuggets, Squirrel Knight and Jouster of the Spring Court, Sworn Guardian and Protector of Lady Jourdain. He's a rather large squirrel hedge beast with keen beady black eyes and a coat of grey. His tail (for very obvious reasons) is his pride and joy. While on duty and dressed in his royal armor, he can be a serious and vengeful creature whose pride and honor take precedence above all. When off the clock and remaining 'nude' however... he's a hornball.

Her energy level is best described as high voltage and her personality rings of youth and innocence and nativity. Of course she's quite charming in her own way, but some may regard her as someone that is completely incompetant or maybe even a bit brain dead. Well, that is until one gets to meet her.%0a%3c %0a%3c Her features are youthful and sweet - among the most notable are her porcelain skin, sweet pink cherub lips, and wide innocent green eyes. Usually, she can be found wearing jeans and pink tshirts with an over-apron, or maybe tights and a tutu. Really, it's entirely dependent upon her mood.%0a%3c %0a%3c '''Mein:''' When her mein is manifest she has a crown of flowers upon her head that are reminiscent of Mucha's art nouveau paintings. Her eyelashes become that of the purple and green tendrils of the passion flower, and there's a thick floral fragrance that hangs in the air. Tiny hummingbirds, bumblebees, and little glass butterflies constantly buzz around her head - nuisances, all of them! - and occasionally she has been known to swat at them. Lastly, where her feet or hands touch the ground or anything organic various tiny flowering plants grow and wither with her passing.%0a%3c %0a---%0a> Mask: Coming Soon%0a> http://i1132.photobucket.com/albums/m568/landsasunder/img-thing_zps7c6a4c93.jpg%0a> Mein: Coming Soon%0a
