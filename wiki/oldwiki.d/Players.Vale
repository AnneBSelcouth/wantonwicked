There is a sadness in her dark eyes which conveys a sense of vulnerability in spite of her stern gaze and aloof affect.

Standard fare includes denim trousers and boots, a fitted t-shirt and a leather motorcycle jacket regardless of the weather. Occasionally, she wears jewelry that depicts obscure religious symbols.

Her penchant for prophetic dreams always seemed to put her in the right place at the right time and Vale quickly earned a reputation as someone who could be relied upon in a hairy situation. All that changed when her husband was killed in the Purge. She doesn't smile anymore. She doesn't sing anymore. She doesn't dream anymore. For the last five years she has been reclusive and disinterested in most Awakened affairs, devoting herself to menial jobs while she searches for those responsible for her husband's murder. Unsubstantiated rumors connect her the wetworks in which some members of her Order are alleged to engage.
