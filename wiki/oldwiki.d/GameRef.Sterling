He was born for the role of the patriarch, groomed throughout his entire life to ensure the success of his industry as well as his family. He's a man who maintains a physical and emotional distance from those he interact with, though, rumor says that he fell apart at the death of his eldest daughter, Eliza, some years ago. He's not a man eager to please, though, he does appreciate those that seek to curry his favor. %0a> %0a> '''Physical Description:''' A coarse man within his late 50's, he has a domineering nature that exudes from the finer touches of his mannerisms. He carries himself with a great gravitas, a conditioning from the previous patriarchs who trained him for his role.

She's active in in high society but has become less gaudy in her later years than she was previously. %0a> %0a> '''Physical Description:''' Selene seems outwardly as a vain woman whose all too concerned with superficial necessities.

Rumors state that he was nearly a doctor before he returned back to the estate, an interesting pursuit given what the families main investments are.

She's a pretty girl in her 20's, rumors at times are known to follow Patia, and the particularly vicious ones state that she's known to bounce in and out of mental health facilities and rehabilitation houses. %0a> %0a> '''Physical Description:''' Long blonde hair and her mothers thin build, she would be pretty if it wasn't for a strange aura that surrounds her.

The American dream unfurled, they began as a modest immigrant family in Augusta, Georgia in 1880. Their modest business of family owned funeral homes grew through hard work and generational progress. Slowly, their name stretched across the state, before finally becoming a powerhouse in the South. %0a> %0a> Though previously seen as a dark and macabre profession, the funeral industry has changed over the years as modernism set in. Gone are the home viewings and used coffins, and incoming are the sleek silk lined coffins of tomorrow, certified to maintain seal for half a century through the miracle of science. Funerals have shifted from small religious gatherings to an anesthetized gathering of individuals to honor the idea of life, rather than death. With these progressive changes, Sterling Industries has changed too. Gone is the image of a mom and pop business, and in,is the Sterling Industries sterile brand, pioneered by the reigning patriarch Frances- Archibald Sterling. %0a> %0a> Though, the Sterling families largest acquisition is the fleet of funeral homes that litter the South, they also maintain a hefty stock market portfolio which holds large slices of recognizable companies in a variety of business sectors, ensuring that their fingers are in almost all of the monetary pies in Georgia.%0a> %0a> Frances-Archibald is the domineering patriarch of the Sterling lineage.
