Her hair fell to midback in gentle waves, sometimes straightened, sometimes loose, sometimes twisted up to be out of the way. The complexion was a golden ivory that looked like it darkened to sun-warmed honey in the summer. She was a tiny thing, of delicate lines and bone structures, gentle curves that were firm yet soft, in a very petite frame that stood all of 4'8''. She could go from easy-going and friendly chatter, to flirtatious imp, to simmering firecracker at the drop of a hat and often used all three to coax a person in, set them at ease, or set them in their place. She always wore a pretty enamel brooch that looked like a family heraldry, and would only tell most that her granddad had given it to her.%0a%0aMien: Behind the mask, the transformation was startling. She was the same size and form as before, simply made into a vessel of flowing glass. Her hair was comprised of fiber thin strands of glass that showed further mastery of her Keeper in glass works by the shades of rich red, yellow and orange to flow from her 'scalp'. There was a very thin seam around her forehead that required a bit of a twist to open, and allowed the interior of her shell to be filled with finely ground coffee beans of a rich chestnut and wet earth color combination. She carried the aroma of an excellently brewed mocha coffee. Her mantle seeped through in the steam to rise from her form which carried her scent and bore the heat of just-starting-to-cool molten glass, and the colors in her strands of glass hair. As in her Mask, the heraldry brooch was visible, craftily painted in enamel and lined in liquid gold above her left breast near the shoulder.%0a%0a[[%3c%3c]]%0ahttp://wantonwicked.gamingsandbox.com/wiki/images/ctl/headers/ctl_h.png%0a''She's only been back in Savannah for the past six months.
