He served a full tour in Iraq, but was forced out when he went through his first change.  He was lucky; his chief was a wolfblood.  The chief sensed his pending change, recognized the spirits, so he kept an eye on him.  As soon as he shifted, the chief tranqed him.  They returned to camp, and the chief arranged to get him a medical discharge, citing PTSD.  %0a%0aThe chief sent him to Savannah to meet up with a friend, a wolf that taught Mikael some of the basics, as well as hooking him up with a contractor from Haliburton.  He signed up for some work in Afghanistan, spending the next four years on various engagements.  During this time, he was joined both the Iron Masters and the Lodge of Arms.  He recently quit after his entire squad was wiped out, deciding to return to the states to make his own way.  With no better destination in mind, he returned to Savannah to find his previous contact.  When he arrived, the contact was gone but he's decided to stay and make a new home.%0a[[%3c%3c]]%0a%0a%25%25http://wantonwicked.gamingsandbox.com/wiki/images/wtf/headers/wtf_rph.png%0a*'''Jarhead:''' Mikael served a tour in Iraq as a Marine Scout Sniper, then returned as a PMC contractor%0a[[%3c%3c]]%0a*'''[[http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0399295/ |Lord of War]]:''' He has friends with the military and in low places as well .... you need a gun, he can probably get it for you.%0a[[%3c%3c]]%0a*'''This is my rifle:''' He's a member of the Lodge of Arms, and is focused on mastering his weapon.
