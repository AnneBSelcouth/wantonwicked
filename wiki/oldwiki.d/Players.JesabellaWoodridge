Velvety, chestnut hair falls in gentle curls along her back, dipping down just a bit below her shoulder-blades. She has a comely face with intense, brown eyes, high cheekbones, and a petite, slightly upturned nose. Her soft, full lips tend to rest in a natural pout, occasionally parting to reveal a pearly white smile. The gentle swell of her bosom would most aptly be described as well-proportioned, her narrow, hourglass-shaped waistline flaring into a pair of feminine hips and long, slender legs. There is something vaguely ethereal about her appearance that makes her seem fragile and brittle, even for a woman. Indeed, she exhibits a delicate demeanour which could only come from an utter and complete lack of physical exertion, telltale signs of a life in comfort and luxury. %0a%25lfloat text-align=center margin-top=5px margin-right=25px margin-bottom=0px margin-left=0px newwin%25 http://s7.postimg.org/5kw5n15q3/jesabella3.jpg%0a%0a%25color=#b95fa7%25 Jesabella rarely dresses in very outrageous or provocative manners; in fact, most of the times she can be seen wearing fairly normal, casual clothes. She often wears a silver crucifix around her neck and has even been known to carry prayer beads, typically wrapped around her left forearm - proudly displaying her pious nature for all to see.%0a%0a%25color=#b95fa7%25 Her religious fervor occasionally stretches even further than that, manifesting itself in the most eccentric ways; for most formal events, she will garb herself in the vestments of anointed clergy that has been tailored specifically to fit her. She will attend charity events, galas, or sometimes even the Prince's court, with the holy scripture in her hands. For a Daeva, she is remarkably astute at coming across as virtuous and chaste.%0a[[%3c%3c]]%0a%0a%25height=40%25http://s15.postimg.org/55bbtyahj/history.png%0a%25rfloat text-align=center margin-top=5px margin-right=0px margin-bottom=5px margin-left=5px newwin%25http://s21.postimg.org/6glu4nq9z/jesprayer.jpg%0a%25color=#b95fa7%25 If anyone asks her, Jesabelle's history is the story of a sinner turned saint. The truth is, as the truth tends to be, far more complex. During the first few years of the twenty first century, her family rose from middle class into the tiny segment of the obscenely rich. This sudden access to wealth and luxury transformed Jesabella into a hedonistic pleasure-seeker; she gradually embraced a lifestyle of parties, alcohol, sex, and drugs. Rather than pursuing an actual career, she would spend her days at fashion events, rockstar performances, and in the most exclusive clubs of Savannah, living off of her father's money. This was how her Sire found her.%0a%0a%25lfloat text-align=center margin-top=5px margin-right=25px margin-bottom=0px margin-left=0px newwin%25 http://s21.postimg.org/r6e85fy6f/sacrosanctlady3.jpg%0a%25color=#b95fa7%25 The Embrace changed her irrevocably. Perhaps the gift of blood was too much of a strain on an already unbalanced mind, perhaps the howls of the Beast within sent her on a quest towards redemption, or perhaps she simply is playing some elaborate scheme? Regardless, Jesabella claims to have found God when she was resurrected from the dead. Since then, she has studied the scriptures of the God Almighty, searching for a path towards spiritual enlightenment and repentance. She is the unofficial leader of a small congregation of believers whose faith is a bastardization of the Abrahamic dogmas. Her temple is a small building known as the Chapel of the Sacrosanct Lady, although some would question whether the 'Lady' refers to the Holy Son's mother or Jesabella herself. She seems to have taken on the role of saviour, saint, and Messiah to her flock, her supernatural presence used to inspire both terror and awe. She is a shepherd and guiding light on the path towards the Lord's mercy and forgiveness.%0a%0a%25height=40%25http://s24.postimg.org/yzgde08k1/contacts.png%0a%25color=#b95fa7%25 • Institutions of faith: Wherever men of Faith dwells, Jesabella goes; she is a familiar face at the more prominent synagogues, churches, and mosques in Savannah.

Since then, she has studied the scriptures of the God Almighty, searching for a path towards spiritual enlightenment and repentance.

Velvety, chestnut hair falls in gentle curls along her back, dipping down just a bit below her shoulder-blades. She has a comely face with intense, brown eyes, high cheekbones, and a petite, slightly upturned nose. Her soft, full lips tend to rest in a natural pout, occasionally parting to reveal a pearly white smile. The gentle swell of her bosom would most aptly be described as well-proportioned, her narrow, hourglass-shaped waistline flaring into a pair of feminine hips and long, slender legs. There is something vaguely ethereal about her appearance that makes her seem fragile and brittle, even for a woman. Indeed, she exhibits a delicate demeanour which could only come from an utter and complete lack of physical exertion, telltale signs of a life in comfort and luxury. %0a---%0a> %25color=#b95fa7%25 Jesabella is young and attractive, possessing a certain captivating beauty that is not all too uncommon amogst her clan.

The truth is, as the truth tends to be, far more complex. During the first few years of the twenty first century, her family rose from middle class into the tiny segment of the obscenely rich. This sudden access to wealth and luxury transformed Jesabella into a hedonistic pleasure-seeker; she gradually embraced a lifestyle of parties, alcohol, sex, and drugs. Rather than pursuing an actual career, she would spend her days at fashion events, rockstar performances, and in the most exclusive clubs of Savannah, living off of her father's money. This was how her Sire found her.%0a%3c %0a%3c %25lfloat text-align=center margin-top=5px margin-right=25px margin-bottom=0px margin-left=0px newwin%25 http://s21.postimg.org/r6e85fy6f/sacrosanctlady3.jpg%0a%3c %25color=#b95fa7%25 The Embrace changed her irrevocably.
