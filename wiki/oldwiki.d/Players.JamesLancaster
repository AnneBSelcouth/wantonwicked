Most of these show the signs of actual farm work. He doesn't bother to hide the pistol when working on the ranch. In both of these styles he wears a cowboy hat.

'''%25color=#78724C%25(Werewolf) The Lancaster Family has a completely different connotation  for the Forsaken of the South. It is a well know and perhaps well hated family of Ivory Claws. Could James be still working for them? Could he really be willing to work with the Forsaken. If so he would be the first of that Family to Betray it and live... for now.\\%0a%3c %25width=25%25http://wantonwicked.gamingsandbox.com/wiki/images/vtr/symbols/vtr_c_g.png%25color=#78724C%25'''Gangrel''' %25color=#762216%25(vampire) %25color=#78724C%25 James is a known Ghoul of Eleanor Woodward.

diff:1382575004:1382574815:=33c33%0a%3c James Lancaster is from Charlotte, North Carolina of the Lancasters of Charlotte. He grew up rich, ridiculously rich, the kind of rich where you can't spend it all if you tried for a hundred years. Private Schools and body guards were a normal for him growing up. This made him slightly eccentric in many ways. He went to Yale, and then Harvard Law. He certainly didn't graduate top of his class, however shortly after graduation he took a possition in the DA's office in Savannah. Many in upper society expect he is making a move for politics.  %0a---%0a> James Lancaster is from Charlotte, North Carolina of the Lancasters of Charlotte.

When he is working on the ranch it isn't as stlyed and will look slightly more disheveled. His eyes are a striking blue and seem to be a window to a troubled soul. it seems that he almost always has something on his mind. His strong chin gives his face a determined and resolved look. James has two distinctive styles and it is easy to tell what he has been doing lately based on which one he is currently sporting. The first is for work. This is a fine hand tailored three piece suit. He is normally carrying a brief case when he is going to or coming from work as well. For those who are observant there is a shoulder holster with a S&W99. His other style is much more functional than stylish. Blue Jeans and a plaid cotton shirt. Most of these show the signs of actual farm work. In both of these styles he wears a cowboy hat. It is almost an identifying part of his style. He only takes it off in court, always respectful of the law.  %0a%3c %0a%3c %0a---%0a> Lorem ipsum dolor sit amet, consectetur adipiscing elit.
