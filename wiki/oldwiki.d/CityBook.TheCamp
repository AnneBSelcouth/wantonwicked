So far, it features a large pit dug several meters into the ground which serves as an arena, a solidly build shed for storage of firewood, a small watch-tower built into a tall tree and an abandoned old but quite large Cabin with a well that used to belong to the Department of Fish & Wildlife that manages the Federal Reserve. The camp is located in a large clearing, and there is no visible path to or from it. The start of a wooden palisade is found in the southern most end of the camp, and more logs lay ready to be put to use...%0a%0aThe relatively large cabin features a dinner room/kitchen, a cramped bunk room with 6 bunk beds and 12 tall lockers and an outdoors toilet. A sophisticated pumping system can draw water from the well and directly into the cabin's water-supply tank, this requires hours if not days of manual labor to fill up or electricity to power the pump and fortunately the cabin has an old gasoline powered generator, and a water-heater. As a result, 4 out-door shower-heads were added to the cabin under an extension of the roof and later completely shielded in by blurred glass windows in place of walls that have since taken a mossy green color. Apart from this, the cabin features a small working space for taking care of bagged pray and has otherwise a sizable basement.
