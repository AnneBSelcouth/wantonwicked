It is styled as an old fashioned diner, open 7 days a week, 24 hours a day and serving reasonable food at reasonable prices.  The menu offers a wide selection of choices as well as unique specials.%0a%0aThe Diner on Abercorn is a locally operated family restaurant, run by Margie and Stephen Anderson since it was first purchased in 1995.  Over the next 18 years the diner gained a reputation for its down home style cooking that made it a popular place for locals, and for the incredible pies and cakes made by Margie Anderson.  In fact, few Savannah citizens would dream of leaving without at least one slice of Margie's cakes and her pies grace more than a few tables around the holidays.  %0a%0a%25lfloat text-align=center margin-top=5px margin-right=0px width=400 margin-bottom=5px margin-left=15px%25http://friedgreensavannah.files.wordpress.com/2012/04/the-diner-on-abercorn-2.jpg%0a%0aThe building is remarkably small, the space could be described as "cramped" by the charitable.  A row of four bubblegum pink bar stools supply the building with all of the counter seating it has; offering a clear line of view across to the line cooks as they prepare food.  In contrast to the pink, the rest of the seating of the diner is comprised of the blue booths that line the walls to create a small linoleum path for customers and waitresses alike to navigate.  The contrasting color, the mint blue ceiling accents and the saucer lighting go a long way in creating the kitch atmosphere of the tiny diner.%0a%0aDespite Stephen's every effort, the line cooks have yet to adopt white paper hats.  Instead they wear blue baseball caps that match their blue shirts and in turn the ceiling accents, along with black pants and black aprons.  Conversely, the waitresses (due to the uniform color the staff has yet to successfully hire a waiter) wear bubblegum pink and white shirt-dresses that come just past the knee, with white cuffed sleeves, white collars and usually white tennis shoes making the staff match the decor.%0a%0aDuring the summer, special markers are left out in the parking lot to denote which spaces are "car hop" locations; diners are treated to roller waitresses on the weekends.  %0a%0a%25rfloat text-align=center margin-top=5px margin-right=0px width=400 margin-bottom=5px margin-left=15px%25http://s3-media3.ak.yelpcdn.com/bphoto/WLThqkaSXdppZXEI0iS8xg/l.jpg%0a%0aThe atmosphere of the Diner of Abercorn would be best described as "homey" as there's something about the nature of the restaurant that makes it easy to relax.  Many a person has found themselves surprisingly recanting all of their woes to a waitress or even Margie and Stephen themselves over a cup of coffee despite having no intention of spilling their troubles.  Due to their being God-fearing Christians, Margie and Stephen Anderson have a tendency to hire staff based more on need than on actual qualifications, leading to more than a few second chances and new starts finding their way forward from the Diner.

He prefers his line cooks to his son/managers and the attitude has started to build up resentment on both sides.  Prior to being a cook, Stephen was in the army, though he doesn't like to speak on his time there, much.

It is styled as an old fashioned diner, open 7 days a week, 24 hours a day and serving reasonable food at reasonable prices.  The menu offers a wide selection of choices as well as unique specials.%0a%3c %0a%3c The Diner on Abercorn is a locally operated family restaurant, run by Margie and Stephen Anderson since it was first purchased in 1995.  Over the next 18 years the diner gained a reputation for its down home style cooking that made it a popular place for locals, and for the incredible pies and cakes made by Margie Anderson.  In fact, few Savannah citizens would dream of leaving without at least one slice of Margie's cakes and her pies grace more than a few tables around the holidays.  %0a%3c %0a%3c %25lfloat text-align=center margin-top=5px margin-right=0px width=400 margin-bottom=5px margin-left=15px%25http://friedgreensavannah.files.wordpress.com/2012/04/the-diner-on-abercorn-2.jpg%0a%3c %0a%3c The building is remarkably small, the space could be described as "cramped" by the charitable.   floor has a bar and booths, the brick walls exposed next to the booths.
