He has dark hair, with incredibly piercing green eyes.''%0a%0a''%25color=#9e0b0f%25He speaks quietly with no hint of accent, his voice a pleasant baritone.  He moves confidentally, making eye contact whenever he speaks with someone.''%0a%0a''%25color=#9e0b0f%25Jackson normally wears a custom European cologne, with a vertical structure built around woody notes.

He went on to a successful undergrad and law school career, attending Harvard Business School and Georgetown Law.  He received an offer from Skadden, and he went to work with one of the top law firms in the country.  After only one year, he got a call from one of the school's many distinguished alum.  The man, Paul Adrestos, gave him an offer he couldn't refuse.  Jackson flew out to Detroit at Paul's request, and they had an extended conversation.''%0a%0a''%25color=#9e0b0f%25Paul embraced him soon after, bringing him into the family.  He spent the next five years working within the kindred of Detroit, learning his way around both the First and Second Estate.  He naturally gravitated towards the first, and was soon brought into the covenant officially.  He was instrumental in establishing an Elysium within the city, earning the title of Lord.  Several months ago, he saw an opportunity in Savannah.  He moves there, purchasing a church in the Bay Side District, converting it into a bar called the Last Cathedral.  He has plans to expand, making it into a night club soon.''%0a[[%3c%3c]]%0a%25rfloat text-align=center margin-top=5px margin-right=15px margin-bottom=5px margin-left=0px height=400 newwin%25http://amourdelavie.net/schreier/side3.jpg%0ahttp://amourdelavie.net/Mortal/rphooks5.png%0a%25width=25%25http://wantonwicked.gamingsandbox.com/wiki/images/wod/smallsymbols/wod_s.png '''%25newwin%25%25color=#9e0b0f%25[-The Bar'''-] [-%25color=#9e0b0f%25(Anyone):-] %25color=#9e0b0f%25[-Jackson owns a bar, -][-[[CityBook.TheLastCathedral|%25color=White%25The Last Cathedral]]-]. %25color=#9e0b0f%25[-You may be a patron, or looking for a place to hang out.-]\\%0a%25width=25%25http://wantonwicked.gamingsandbox.com/wiki/images/wod/smallsymbols/wod_s.png'''%25newwin%25%25color=#9e0b0f%25[-The Schools-]''' [-%25color=#9e0b0f%25(Anyone):-]%25color=#9e0b0f%25[-Jackson went to Harvard Business School and Georgetown Law.-]\\%0a%25width=25%25http://wantonwicked.gamingsandbox.com/wiki/images/wod/smallsymbols/wod_s.png  '''%25newwin%25%25color=#9e0b0f%25[-The Capital-]'''[- %25color=#9e0b0f%25(Anyone):-]%25color=#9e0b0f%25[-He went through the foster care system for years in DC, then attended Georgetown Prep.-]\\%0a%25width=25%25http://wantonwicked.gamingsandbox.com/wiki/images/wod/smallsymbols/wod_s.png  '''%25newwin%25%25color=#9e0b0f%25[-Motor City-]'''[- %25color=#9e0b0f%25(Anyone): -] %25color=#9e0b0f%25[-He's been in Detroit the last five years, working with both kindred and kine to rise to power and wealth.-]%0a%25width=25%25http://wantonwicked.gamingsandbox.com/wiki/images/wod/smallsymbols/vtr_s.png'''%25newwin%25%25color=#9e0b0f%25[-The Unconquered-]''' [-%25color=#9e0b0f%25(Vampire):-] %25color=#9e0b0f%25[-He is a Lord among the Invictus for his service to the covenant.
