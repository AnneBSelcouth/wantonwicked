The threats to the Awakened world are numerous. From the Awakened servants of the Exarchs known as the Seers of the Throne (those dedicated to enslaving the sleeping world with the denial of their supernal birthright,) to the Banishers (the mistaken pariah of their Awakened brethren who seek to eradicate those who are Awakened… including themselves,) the Adamantine Arrow contests with others whose knowledge of the Supernal makes them a most dangerous foe. If this were not enough there are other threats, non-human threats that hunt and haunt the Awakened.  Abyssal  entities which force their way into this plane, the summoned avatars of other realms who break their conjurors’ hold and run rampant in the mundane world, the spirits and ghosts, automatons and more, each one a threat that the Adamantine Arrow is expected to face. Lastly, there are sleepers, humans, who would hunt the Awakened, dangerous individual who have not seen the truth behind the lie, yet threaten the existence of the Awakened people. The Adamantine Arrows is a proud order, taking their roles in the continued survival of the Awakened with a seriousness that is only found in the warrior heroes of the ancient epics.%0a> %0a> The Adamantine Arrows are warriors, but like all squares are rectangles and not all rectangles are squares the Arrow display their roles as a warrior in different ways. Some, yes some are inheritors of the military culture, the solider and sailor, the trained and disciplined Awakened who has spent years learning a mortal craft only to apply it to their Awakened State. They are also the athlete and the martial artist, the dedicated and conditioned mind that is focused and able to understand order and training. There are the politicians, the educated, and the students who learn and develop tactics and strategies to employ against the enemies of the awakened. There are the artists, the creators, the ones who work at the supernal smithies, forging items that some Arrows must use to defeat the greatest of threats. The Adamantine Arrow is not one dimensional, though many cannot see through the wall of warriors to find the apparatus that keeps all militaries running. %0a> %0a> The Adamantine Arrow will always be defined by their relationship to conflict, it is central to their existence, their being. But conflict happens every day in the mundane world, often happening without a shot being fired. The political battlefield is as brutal and demanding as the sands of the Middle East.  The Adamantine Arrow seeks to protect the Awakened, and itself as an Order, against any threat, and there is constant vigilance, a constancy of purpose, and continued acceptance of the challenges place before them. Conflict is eternal, the conflict is life, whether it is mastering a skill or sighting an enemy in the crosshairs of a weapon, the Arrow strive to remain in a constant state of action, life is defined by conflict.%0a>  [--%25color=#365776%25[[#top| Back to top]]--]%0a> %0a> [[#AA-P]]%0a> !!!Playing an Adamantine Arrow%0a> %0a> The arrow is much more varied than the core lets on. The Adamantine Arrow is not simply a “break glass in case of war” order. They compete amongst themselves, they compete against the Consilium and they compete, in many ways, against the sleeping world. When thinking of a concept for an Arrow, realize that no army is without an infrastructure, a bureaucracy, and its politicians. Sometimes the most important person in the battle is the one who can position the troops in the right place at the right time. %0a> %0a> The skills you take as an Arrow will be varied, but you should include at least one fighting style. Stamina is more important than brute force for the Adamantine Arrow for a multitude of reasons; one of the most important reasons is stamina defines how many spells can be cast on your character (by your character or by others) before you take a negative modifier(s) as your pattern frays/overloads. When you pick you skills think of your concept and work up from there. A scout doesn’t necessarily have to be the combat wombat; they may prefer never to be seen instead using arcana to enhance mundane abilities. The strategist will be higher mental than the politician who will need social combat skills. Remember, the Arrow is not all “Rawr, Kill.” What some do with a sword others will do with a knife and still others do with a word. You have flexibility here.%0a> %0a>  [--%25color=#365776%25[[#top| Back to top]]--]%0a> %0a> [[#AA-S]]%0a> !!!Adamantine Arrow Setting%0a> "You see it all around us, Consilium after Consilium seeing our service to the Awakened as some form of conscription into a supernal army. More than one councilor, more than one Hierarch has thrown us in harm's way with little in the way of support, or worry, for our own safety. We are the Adamantine Arrow, we are not mindless machines that are to be used at the whim of those who think they know better. In the past, you may have expected blind submission to the word of the Consilium. That was the past. We, the Adamantine Arrow will continue to serve the Consilium of Consilium, but we will never again serve blindly; and because you have wasted our goodwill, we will no longer serve for free." ‘‘Kreig’’ addressing ‘’Titus’’, Silver Ladder Hierarch and the Savannah Consilium, August 2002%0a> %0a> The Arrow of Savannah are under the guidance of Adamant Sage ‘’Krieg’’ and the Arrows exist in an odd nervous détente with the other orders. ‘’Krieg’’ has seen the Adamantine Arrow used as the meat shield for politicos in times of war, only to be discarded or made into pariahs for the zeal they use to defend a Consilium. ‘‘Kreig’’ left his previous Consilium over a decade ago, disgusted with the way the Arrow was treated, and what was worse, the way the Arrow accepted this treatment… Krieg refused to let this happen again. %0a> %0a> The Arrow is almost mercenary in regards to a mustering of a full order. When other orders need the use of specific Arrows, then there is a price for their service. While Krieg does not require Arrows who have joined cabals to charge a tithe to their cabal mates, but when specialists are needed there is always a fee. This, in no uncertain terms, makes the Consilium nervous because what Krieg is doing is not against the Lex in any way, and it would appear that they have no choice but to acquiesce to the way the Order is run. ‘’Krieg’’ has created “fire-teams” that respond to various problems. Starting with the bare minimum of two Arrows, because an Arrow never serves alone, the fire teams operate to support Consilium and Order goals. From this basic unit the Fire Teams can grow in size to up to eight Arrows working in conjunction and often under a First Talon or a brevetted First Talon for an operation. While operational “command” of these units can be under the leadership of another Awakened, strategic and tactical command always resides in the hands of the ranking Arrow or the deal is not agreed to. %0a> %0a> Right now there is loyalty to the Consilium, but at what price? The relationship with the Guardians of the Veil is neutral to oddly friendly; the Order respects the position the Guardians of the Veil, seeing them as survivors in way. Despite public opposition to the order, ‘‘Kreig’’ appears to support their current mission. The relationship with the Silver Ladder is … cool, each Order seeming to respect the other and not looking to enforce their internal policies on another. The relationship with the Free Council is strained, the Arrow disagreeing with the way the “victors” have treated other orders with the upheaval in the past. To the Mysterium, it is hard to tell, it is a political relationship that is hard to judge and to which Krieg has said little about.%0a> %0a> The Arrow are not perfect, the conflict that they encounter and keep in their lives defies the use of this word, but they are organized and they are unified to the outside eye. ‘’Krieg’s’’ subordinates support his methods in public, and in private there is no talk of dissention. The fact that he has promised and kept his word on how he perceives the order has bought him loyalty as a leader that is fierce among the First Talons and the Thunderbolt Guardian. This is not to say he cannot be questioned, questioning and revolution are part of the Phalanxes, but so far, the questions have been few. ‘’Krieg’’ does not hold himself above the mandates he has set, anyone can challenge his leadership… all they have to do is face him in single combat.%0a> %0a> [--%25color=#365776%25[[#top| Back to top]]--]%0a> %0a> [[#AA-OS]]%0a> !!!Adamantine Arrow Order Status%0a> Make sure you have taken a look at the status primer as it will give you the overview for the entire venue. This portion will be broken down into two distinct parts. The status in the order and the status in the Consilium:%0a> %0a> To gain status in the order begins with what is covered in the status primer. Forward the goals of the arrows. Contest and conquer objectives as defined by the Adamant Sage or a Ranking Arrow. In combat defeat the enemy if that is the goal, capture if commanded to do so. Never abandon another Arrow in the field, and confrontation with other Arrows is /ALWAYS/ done behind closed does. To the rest of the Consilium, the Arrow is one, pissing contests and jockeying for position is never discussed in front of others. One does not talk about Fight Club. %0a> %0a> Defending the order from attacks, both from the enemies of the Consilium and the Consilium itself is part of the way to gain status. Another way is to forward your understanding of the Arrow and its ways. In the Adamantine Arrow supplement there are core ideals called the [[#AA-Ph|Phalanxes]].%0a> %0a> [--%25color=#365776%25[[#top| Back to top]]--]%0a> %0a> [[#AA-CS]]%0a> !!!Adamantine Arrows and Consilium Status%0a> An Arrow can gain status in the Consilium by performing Consilium required tasks, many of which will parallel tasks assigned by the order. Defending the Consilium in times of war, persecuting the enemies in a fashion hat upholds the integrity and the stability of the Consilium, being a presence in the event members of other Consili visit. These are easy ways for the common arrow to rise in some stature. There are other ways, such as taking active roles in the Consilium that the Arrow is part of these roles can include Councilor or Provost to a cabal, the position of Sentinel or of Herald. Also, for enterprising players the character could learn from another order, taking order specific titles (such as the Silver Ladder Factotum [lawyer of the Lex]) as a way to represent the adaptability of the Arrow as an order. The positions of the Consilium and of other order will be discussed in other posts.

If you have the book you are willing to read the information there, but more importantly, you will define these concepts in your character’s terms. When looking to advance you will be required to understand and define what these ideals mean in game for you. It will take a little bit of writing, but you do not have to write a novella. Also, you will not have to write on each subject, when looking to advance you will be given a selection of these ideals and you need to format them in a way that is congruent to how you have been playing your character. Status will not just be handed out because you want to rise in rank, there is some work to do.%0a> %0a>  [--%25color=#365776%25[[#top| Back to top]]--]%0a> %0a> [[#AA-Pos]]%0a> !!!Positions in the Adamantine Arrow%0a> Status 0-1 - Talon - Rank and File member of the order. Welcome to fight club.%0a> %0a> :Status 1 Banner Warden: An Arrow who has proven their worth and has joined a cabal can earn the title  of Banner Warden. They, in essence, become the champion for the cabal, accepting duels and often becoming the second in command in a cabal. In formal situations, it is the Banner Warden who carries the “arms” or the “heraldry” of the cabal when meeting others. (Side note, normally  order responsibilities are lessened on a Banner Warden as the Arrow respects their commitment to a cabal.)%0a> %0a> :Status 2 First Talon: An Arrow reaching First Talon is now “officer” status, they can command in the field and are usually being groomed in other forms of combat than their natural battlefield. A politician begins to learn more hand to hand, a combat mage begins to develop more tactics. These are the “doers” in the Order.%0a> %0a> :Status 3 Thunderbolt Guardian: To many the Thunderbolt Guardian is seen as a higher ranking officer, but in practice the Thunderbolt Guardian is supposed to be the teacher or mentor to other arrows as they continue their conflict. At this level they are also the specialists, if a Talon is the infantry then Thunderbolt Guardians are Delta. After the First Talon has learned to broaden their abilities it is the Thunderbolt Guardian who then relearns a focus and specialty.%0a> %0a> :Status 4+  The Adamant Sage: More than a general, the Adamant Sage is a force. They are often times masters of multiple arcana; they have honed their focus as a Thunderbolt Guardian to transcend practice into art. They are pinnacles of the Arrow, and are often counselors to the Consilium in more ways than just in times of war. The Adamant Sage is the Vision of the Arrow in an area, they are required to be more than just powerful Awakened, and they are to balance their supernal with mundane skills and abilities as well.%0a> %0a>  [--%25color=#365776%25[[#top| Back to top]]--]%0a> %0a>  [[#FC]]%0a> !!The Free Council%0a> %25lfloat text-align=center margin-top=5px margin-right=15px margin-bottom=5px margin-left=0px%25http://wantonwicked.gamingsandbox.com/wiki/images/mta/symbols/mta_logo_fc.png%0a> “We want the world and we want it now!” Famous lyrics from a song that half of this generation would never recognize amid the auto-tuned synth-pop that is mass marketed and fed to the youth like genetically altered feed to cows. This is the Free Council, the revolution with a cause that is the sword of Damocles poised above the throats of the wise. Escape the past, leave the shackles of failure and of Atlantis and strive to the future. This is part of the perception of the Free Council. To some the Libertines are little more than raving lunatics, fanatics bent on taking the history and the tradition of Atlantis and trading upon it in some fevered lemming rush to a supposed Democratic Utopia. If it were that easy then maybe the landscape of the Pentacle would have changed.%0a> %0a> It’s never that easy.%0a> %0a> Yes, there are those who fit the mold of the anarchist, the revolutionary, and they martyr…never forget the martyrs. But there are also the teachers, the educators, the historians and those who seek to build on the mistakes of the past to provide for a better future. To some, the only difference between the Free Council and the Silver Ladder is public relations and press coverage. The Free Council do look to the future, often time chafing at the plodding of the Diamond in its slow trek to Ascension.  The Free Council is made up of as many half-truths as any of the other orders. The Free Council is not free, and it is not exactly a Council. Without organization the libertines would have never succeeded in formulating their own order, without sacrifice and adherence to as many mandates and policies as the other order the Order would have crumbled under its own weight. The cogs of progress are lubricated with the ideals of the visionaries, but the pathway to hell is coated in their good intentions.%0a> %0a> To be a Libertine is to understand an internal conflict, to strive for a future set on the ruins of the past. Instead of blind ambition the rose colored glasses of idealism are often the most common possession of many a Libertine’s satchel of useful tools. Belief in the future of all awakened, belief that something better is still to come; these are some of the hallmarks of the Libertines. Derision to those stuck in the past, a jester’s mocking of the king, the conflict of the Free Council and the Atlantean Orders is not a war. There must be someone willing to question the past, someone willing to use it to light the future. When the other orders develop tunnel vision based on myth it is the Free Council’s job to light the fire, to burn away superstition and show what potential awaits the Awakened nation.%0a> %0a> Activist, politician, teacher, conspiracy theorist, anyone can be a member of the Free Council. Some will teach, others will learn. Some will lead and others will follow. The Free Council is not an army of mindless revolutionaries, instead they are a group of Awakened that know the best is yet to come.%0a> %0a>  [--%25color=#365776%25[[#top| Back to top]]--]%0a> %0a> [[#FC-P]]%0a> !!!Playing a Libertine%0a> Like any other order, there are stereotypes. “Revolution Calling” is not just a song by Queensryche, it is a prevailing concept in the Free Council and the application of this thought is as different as the members who make up the Order. The Free Council looks to tomorrow, some do so blindly, regardless of the lessons of the past. Some look forward with peril to their soul, their health, their integrity. Others carefully plot their course, looking to play the game of the Awakened, politicians as ruthless and cunning as any found in the Diamond. These are the heralds of the future, or so they would have you believe, and some actually live up to the billing.%0a> %0a> The skills needed by the Free Council cannot be quantified as an order. A scientist is not the same as a student; a revolutionary is not the same as a martyr.  Dedication to the cause can appear in a myriad of ways that are customizable to the character being played. In some ways physical stats will be important if a Libertine is going the might makes right route, to others it will be social or mental attributes and skills that are prized.  Try not to pigeon hold you Libertine with the thought that everything must happen now, look for the long game, the future is coming no matter what you say or do. It is up to the Free Council to try and shape it to be better than the past.%0a> %0a>  [--%25color=#365776%25[[#top| Back to top]]--]%0a> %0a> [[#FC-S]]%0a> !!!Free Council Setting%0a> Becoming the norm is a bitch, becoming the institution is even worse. The Free Council in Savannah is in an odd position; they appear to be in charge without having to sit in the big chair. The situation is convoluted to say the least, but it is a truth.%0a> %0a> Five years ago a pogrom against the Guardians of the Veil was laid at the Hierarch’s feet. Titus, a Silver Ladder, was run out of town under accusations of supporting the Abyss, the Seers, and about anyone else the Consilium could blame for the death of so many awakened. The apostate population was culled, even the Free Council wanted blood in those days. Afterwards the Consilium was wrecked, one order was decimated, and another was in shambles. It was at this time that -Heron,- the head of the Assembly in Savannah, was offered the Hierarch’s  position by the ranking members of the Mysterium. The Arrow didn’t want the spot, the Silver Ladder was stained by Titus and the accusations against him and the Guardians were in Shambles. %0a> %0a> In what can only be described as a “dick” move, ‘‘Heron’’ instead suggested that the Guardians would be safest if one of their members was Hierarch. In short, ‘‘Heron’’ sidestepped direct responsibility to the Consilium and forced a Guardian into a position they didn’t want. It was a coup, a Mask was now, in -Heron’s- mind, and impotent figurehead that had to stay in front of the eyes of the Consilium at all order when they had to run the Consilium.  ‘‘Heron’’ proved  himself to be an astute politician, one capable of leading without needing a title to do it and this act was just the beginning.%0a> %0a> In the last five years ‘‘Heron’’ has made sure that there is enough Consilium business to keep the masks weak in physical power. The Silver Ladder, yeah, they are recovering, but it is slow. The Ladder’s pride took the brunt of the damage and ‘‘Heron’’ is sometimes liberal in reminding the Magisters about this.  Following -Heron’s- lead, the Free Council took the opportunity to show the Ladder that living in the past, or what the Libertines see as the past, was not the way to go. %0a> %0a> How did they show the Silver Ladder that the old ways didn’t work, well, they stepped in and operated the Consilium how they thought it should be ran. In doing this they, the Free Council, became the institution; a shift they did not see coming and were, at first, not prepared to adapt to.  The Mysterium was not dabbling in politics, busy with their own pursuits,  and the Arrows were their normal quiet self under the leadership of ‘‘Kreig’’.  Suddenly the Free Council was doing all the leg work in the Consilium, a role that they had to take to prove the old ways were wrong and, initially, they seemed to be up to the task. There was some change, but over the course of the last five years the Libertines find themselves following the old methods, in regards to the Consilium, instead of forging new methods. To some this was lazy, to others it was what was needed. The Free Council seemed to lose some of its vision and there has been talk that ‘‘Heron’’ spends too much time resting on his laurels.%0a> %0a> The current state for the Free Council is the natural state of the Free Council, one of change, a flux caught in the moment right before it sparks. The Free Council has made some change happen, but they have also fallen into old habits. They are not the outcast order, they are not the young upstarts. Here in Savannah they are the institution, not as an Assembly for all Awakened, but as the current backbone of the Consilium. There are perks, the Free Council has been able to keep the Guardians in check, the Silver Ladder cowed and appear to have little in the way of opposition from the Arrows and the Mysterium. The problem, as some see it, is that the Free Council has a lot of what it wants… and no idea what to do with it. ‘‘Heron’’ leads the Free Council, but does not lead the Consilium. The work supporting the Consilium and the Awakened has fallen to the rank and file. %0a> %0a> It is hard to say if the revolution has ended, or if it is just beginning. The Consilium functions, the Assembly is still intact, though it is a majority of the Consilium now. And oddly enough, the Hierarch, a Guardian of the Veil has never stopped the Free Council from trying to make change, at times even supporting the Libertine cause and ideals. Strange times that, times that make many libertine question, “What’s next?”%0a> %0a>  [--%25color=#365776%25[[#top| Back to top]]--]%0a> %0a> [[#FC-OS]]%0a> !!!Free Council Order Status%0a> Make sure you have taken a look at the status primer as it will give you the overview for the entire venue.

If you have the book you are willing to read the information there, but more importantly, you will define these concepts in your character’s terms. When looking to advance you will be required to understand and define what these ideals mean in game for you. It will take a little bit of writing, but you do not have to write a novella. Also, you will not have to write on each subject, when looking to advance you will be given a selection of these ideals and you need to format them in a way that is congruent to how you have been playing your character.

Expected to follow company policy, the Voter could be asked to jump through hoops before gaining this status, but once they are established, they serve to strengthen the Libertines by helping guide the order though their participation in the Assembly.%0a> Status 1-3- Emissary- Starting as a 1 dot status, the emissary is a common position within the Free Council. Like internal heralds, the emissary is a form of contact between estranged Consili and Free Council Assemblies. %0a>  %0a> :Status 1-3 Minutemen: These are the martial arm of the Free Council, those who are willing to fight, even die, for the cause. They serve the Assembly, and also can gain this status by fighting for a Consilium. To become a minuteman, the Voter must volunteer, and then they are considered in service to the Assembly in a military. Some would also say policemen.%0a> %0a> :Status 1-5 Syndic: Politicians to the core, these are the voice and the fire in the Free Council.  Equal parts charisma and chutzpah, these are the best and the worst of the free Council. They can lead, they can backstab, and they are a vocal piece of the free council that pushes the assembly, and all those around them, for whatever ideal they serve. They can rise to lead assemblies to greatness… or ruin.%0a> %0a> :Status 2 Host: Becoming a host shows that a voter has displayed some form of organization ability. Whether is providing safe haven for meetings, or making sure everyone attends meetings, the host is the grass-roots organizer that provides the backbone for the organization of the order.%0a> %0a> :Status 2-4 Letter Carrier: Like an Emissary the Letter Carrier is a type of emissary, though, there is a bit more to this position than the other. First, the letter carrier is known to travel abroad, second the letter carrier volunteers to have the memory altered with arcana so that they do not know what it is that they carry. A dedicated role, this is not used as much as it once was. Odd, to note, that a libertine would be willing to sacrifice a personal freedom to perform this task, but it does happen.%0a> %0a> :Status 2-4 Citizen Agent: These Libertines are more than Minutemen, they are the agents-provocateur, the spies and then covert operatives of the Assembly.  In an order with truth and openness as part of its bylines, the Citizen Agent is often hidden, unannounced in their role and their importance. They often answer to a select few of ranking Libertines in an area, sometimes only one.%0a> %0a> :Status 3-5 Strategos:Leaders of focus groups, this sums up the position quickly. Generals, politicians, statesmen and women. The strategos is a hard earned position that often times leads an assembly or represents the libertines in a Consilium. The problem is that outside of the area of expertise they are limited in their influence. A paper tiger or a powerful figure: The strategos is often as powerful as perception of their position allows them.%0a> %0a>  [--%25color=#365776%25[[#top| Back to top]]--]%0a> %0a>  [[#Guardians of the Veil]]%0a> !!Guardians of the Veil%0a> %25lfloat text-align=center margin-top=5px margin-right=15px margin-bottom=5px margin-left=0px%25http://wantonwicked.gamingsandbox.com/wiki/images/mta/symbols/mta_logo_gov.png%0a> The war is always easiest when you know who your enemies are; the truth is simplest when fact is more blatant than fiction. It is easy to lead when the path is clear, easy to see the future when the past is unobscured. For the Guardians of the Veil there is no easy, there is no way that they walk that is not riddled with sacrifice and loss. Lies, deceits, half-truths and shadows are the currency of the Guardians. The fight a war against their own, their enemies are often found inside the very Pentacle they protect. The Guardians protect magic, the Awakened, and they also protect the sleeping world from the Awakened world. When Mages prey upon the sleeping world the Guardians act, when mortal unearth an ancient tome, again they must act. More than the dream police or the supernal FBI, the Guardians believe, with a religious fervor, that their role is to make a better world. %0a> %0a> While they are not the awakened police, per say, they are similar to an IAD, an Internal Affairs Division. They stop Awakened from affecting the mortal world in supernal manners. Whether the vulgar magic, a particular dislike of Guardians because of their dogmatic beliefs, used by a new Free Councilors, or the abuse of sleepwalkers by a Silver Ladder Cryptopoly, the guardians look to uncover the wrongs committed by the Awakened so that they cannot be repeated. Are the Guardian’s their brothers’ keepers? Yes and no, they sacrifice for the Pentacle because while they believe the Awakened must herald in a new age, Guardians know they cannot lead. So they seek to defend, as best they can in manners that they can, so that those who do lead, lead  justly. Their perception, like any other order, can be skewed based on the leadership of the order. %0a> %0a> If this were not enough to cast a shadow of doubt and insecurity when dealing with the Guardians, then their almost cult-like fanaticism and structure is the proverbial nail in their supernal coffin. The order itself believes in prophecy and in the coming of a new age, an age that they, in their service and their suffering, herald into being. It is during this time that the sins of the Guardians will be judged, will ways equal means, or will all the suffering be for naught as the Guardians are once again considered the Pariah of the Awakened. There is no easy answer, there is no simple truth. The Guardians keep their secrets, hiding their motivations deep and dark, for every truth that is uncovered about the order a half dozen lies are used to swaddle the information until there is nothing left to believe.%0a> %0a> Guardians utilize many tactics that mirror the Seers of the Throne, extensively using mortals, sleepwalkers and sleepers alike. A labyrinth is as complex as a Silver Ladder Cryptopoly and twice and dangerous. Here the cults rise and fall, the sins of a few are dispersed to the many, and sometimes, there is a required payment for these sins. Sometimes, the only thing on the menu is the Kool-Aid and there is no choice but to drink.%0a> %0a>  [--%25color=#365776%25[[#top| Back to top]]--]%0a> %0a> [[#Guardians of the Veil-P]]%0a> !!!Playing a Guardian of the Veil%0a> The Guardians here are in a tight spot, everything they do is done in the full view of the Consilium, or, so they say. The Hierarch, a Guardian himself, was forced into the position, one that any Guardian would gladly avoid. But luckily, the Hierarch knows how to play the game, and has made it so that when the Guardians press a case, they win. It has taken some work, but this is not a city where the Guardians try to infiltrate the other orders, or the Seers, The lines are clearly drawn and posted on the Map… almost as if taunting some enemy to strike, to make a … mistake.%0a> %0a> To play a Guardian you are going to have to be able to follow the tenants, the thesis of the Guardians of the Veil while also balancing a very public persona. Your masques, should you choose to utilize them, should be the best face forward so that the Consilium thinks that the Guardians are cornered, and cowed. It will be hard to do, but only the brave can truly understand sacrifice and reward for that suffering.%0a> %0a>  [--%25color=#365776%25[[#top| Back to top]]--]%0a> %0a> [[#Guardians of the Veil-S]]%0a> !!!Guardians of the Veil Setting%0a> The chosen few, the survivors, the Guardians of the Veil still exist in Savannah.  The scars are faded, five years will do that, but the memories are still there hidden behind the eyes. ‘‘Siafu’’ still carries the Hierarch’s title, a title she never sought but now tends to as seriously as can be expected. She refuses to sit down when the Consilium is convened; so it is hard to say she holds that chair. Even now, with all that has been done, all thrones are false. Her voice echoes when she speaks, addressing the present and the past, part of her still lost in events that happened half a decade ago. She and her lieutenant, ‘’Moraceae’’,  are among the handful that survived the pogrom against the Guardians, the few that remember a week’s worth of terror and loss. Some have fled, no longer willing to live in Savannah, others have retreated, sealing themselves away so that their demons do not affect others.  Then there are those that died as they had lived, as Guardians of the Veil in the war against the Lie and the Abyss.%0a> %0a> ‘‘Siafu’’ never asked to be the Hierarch, no, that was a political machination orchestrated by -Heron. - She knows this, but she does not hold it against -Heron, - he does not realize that sacrifice is needed to protect the awakened, the sleepers, and those caught in between. Free Councilors rarely understand sacrifice without martyrdom; sometimes one just has to act without other’s watching.  ‘‘Siafu’’ understands that, understands sacrifice; this is what Guardians do. ‘‘Siafu’s’’ sacrifice is that she must lead the Consilium, for now, as best she can in a role that any Guardian would normally avoid. She understands the price she must pay for being a survivor, for protecting those who remain, and she pays it with quiet service.%0a> %0a> Savannah once held a large contingent of Guardians that operated, not so much with impunity, but with consistency. These were not the shadowy figures that existed in the rumors and myths of other Consili, these were active Awakened who worked in and outside of the Consilium. The Guardians were respected, in a way, by the other orders. They followed the Lex, they performed their duties, and for the most part, they worked outside of the city when they were needed. Their reputation followed them, of course, but they did their best not to live up to the accusations normally reserved for Guardians. %0a> %0a> Now Savannah has a smaller population of Guardians than before, and their public mask has been forced because of the other orders. The Guardians, with ‘‘Siafu’’ as their example, have become adepts at following the rules. Every ‘t” is crossed; every “I” is dotted. They follow the Lex, some becoming quite skilled at its interpretation and application. Before -Titus,- of the Silver Ladder, was accused of collusion with the enemies of the pentacle,  he had mandated that Apostates would be banned from Savannah, holding these unknown members of Awakened society accountable for much of what had happened. Oddly enough, ‘‘Siafu’’ rescinded this mandate, allow Apostates back into the city. Her comment on why she allowed the Apostates back into Savannah as a cryptic, “They have made their sacrifice.” %0a> %0a> The Guardians survive, tenacious and dedicated, they believe in ‘‘Siafu’’ and her leadership. They trust in ‘‘Moraceae’’ and his hand as ‘’Siafu’s’’ lieutenant. The Guardians are willing to sacrifice so that others will be free from the lie, they know that their cause, no matter what others think, is just, and that they will be judged for their actions. Their relationship with the other orders is odd at the best. With the ladder they have a bond built from shame and rebuilding. With the Arrows they receive a quiet admiration for those who survive and continue to fight. The Free Council is haughty, self-stylizing themselves as victors who now can act without their mythic threat of the Guardians hanging above them. The Free Council feels it has this freedom, and for some reason they now act more like a traditional Diamond order. And then there is the Mysterium. No one can judge the relationship between the Guardians and Mysterium, there is a chasm between the two, one of polite détente reminiscent of the Cold War.%0a> %0a>  [--%25color=#365776%25[[#top| Back to top]]--]%0a> %0a> [[#Guardians of the Veil-S]]%0a> !!!Guardian Order Status%0a> Make sure you have taken a look at the status primer as it will give you the overview for the entire venue.

Forward the goals of the Guardians of the Veil, do so in a manner that never implicates the order, never seems to cross the line. Learn the loopholes in the Lex, learn the ways to champion the cause of the order and then make it seem like it is done for the Consilium.%0a> Defending the order from attacks, take the war to the Seers without breaking the truce, and following the tenants of the order in the plain and open view of the Consilium without getting caught, these will increase your status and standing. Another way is to forward your understanding of the Guardians, and its ways. In the GOV supplement there are core ideals and these ideals are the basis of guardian thought.

The trick, then, to call it that, is giving a Consilium no choice but to recognize the worth, and the value, of a Guardian as a member of the Consilium. By performing Consilium required tasks, to the very letter, Guardians can rise to some measure of status in a Consilium. The Consilium can detest a Guardian for their perceived work, but without proof, they egalitarian nature means the a Consilium must reward those who prove their worth.. For enterprising players, a character could learn from another order, in clear view of the Consilium, which would be very un-Guardian behavior.%0a> %0a>  [--%25color=#365776%25[[#top| Back to top]]--]%0a> %0a> [[#Guardians of the Veil-B]]%0a> !!!Beliefs of the Guardians of the Veil%0a> Necessary Secrets and Sins%0a> 	Paradox strengthens the Abyss as punishment for Pride.%0a> 	Sins for a Just End grant Wisdom to the Awakened%0a> Merit Must Guide the Fallen World%0a> The Esoteric Tenets:%0a> 	All Thrones are False all Souls are Flawed%0a> 	There is a Secret Hierarchy of Souls%0a> 	The Hieromagus will fulfill the Diamond Wheel%0a> Praxis: The Law of the Mask%0a> 	Learning to Remember%0a> 	Parables and Koans%0a> 	Oral Histories and Prophecies%0a> The Culture of Secrecy%0a> 	Anonymity and Reticence%0a> 	Habitual Surveillance%0a> 	Levels of Trust%0a> The Divine Thread%0a> 	Defend the Awakened%0a> 	Protect the Sanctity of Magic%0a> 	Weaken the Enemies of Atlantis%0a> 	Prepare the Way for the Hieromagus%0a> %0a> You will notice I did not add what each of these means.

They are to develop, as their name suggests, cults that follow the doctrine of an Epopt. These members of the Guardians of the Veil are tasked with the creation of Labyrinths, secret societies and occult groups that follow whatever mandate is set forth by the Guardians of the Veil. They are active, leaders from the shadow even as their Silver Ladder counterparts lead from the pulpit. They lie, they exaggerate or depreciate the words of others. They are confidants, best friends and dangerous enemies. Successful creation of a labyrinth does not always end for the Awakening of its members, sometimes it ends with their deaths.%0a> %0a> :Status 1 Emissary: The order appointed herald of sorts; the emissary is meant to be a tool of communication between the Guardians of the Veil and other orders. Unlike its Consilium counterpart, the Emissary has been known to use blackmail, threats, and other nefarious means to communicate the wishes of the Guardians to other Awakened. Working both within, and outside of the order, it is the emissary that often relays messages from the Epopt to Cultors, though their status is the same, the message comes from on high and the words are best when followed.%0a> %0a> :Status 2 Interfector:It is at this level of status that the Guardians earn the ire of this rest of the awakened. Torturers, murderers and assassins the Interfector position is the blood hand of the Guardians of the Veil. Used carefully, and not always acknowledge by the Consilium which supports the Guardians, the Interfector plays the role of the evil that must be done. Occasionally, however, it is the Interfectors who must bear the brunt of the anger of the Consilium, the position is not for the weak of heart. They are not blind in their devotion, they must balance their need with the need of the Consilium and the Guardians of the Veil, but when they are called upon they must be able to act without flinching.%0a> %0a> :Status 3 Susceptor:The Specialists of the Guardians, the Susceptor position is one fraught with perils unlike the other positions. Where Interfectors may be used as scapegoats and occasional object lessons Susceptors do not have the shielding influence of the Guardians to protect them. They are often the spies, the deep agents focused on a specific goal. They often must work alone, but their work is important to the Guardian cause.%0a> %0a> :Status 4 Epopt: Unlike a totalitarian ruler that one might expect, the Epopt is a politician and a communicator. The role of the Cultor has a certain need for independence and it is the job of the Epopt to organize these various independent factions so that they work together. They must balance the ebb and the flow of politics within the Consilium so that while everyone may suspect the Guardians of misdoings, they have no proof. Of all the members of the Guardians, it is the Epopt who knows the majority of the secrets of the Guardians; therefore, they are the most protected.%0a> %0a>  [--%25color=#365776%25[[#top| Back to top]]--]%0a> %0a> [[#TM]]%0a> !!The Mysterium%0a> %25lfloat text-align=center margin-top=5px margin-right=15px margin-bottom=5px margin-left=0px%25http://wantonwicked.gamingsandbox.com/wiki/images/mta/symbols/mta_logo_m.png%0a> The days of pulp, of action and adventure in an idealized time, live large and strong in the minds of the sleepers and awakening does not change the draw to the fantastic. Stories about quests, of plumbing hidden depths, the search for ancient lore and more importantly, treasure, are a favorite escape. The silver screen has made Quartermain, O’Connell and Carnahan, Croft and Jones names that invoke images of fedora’s and dusty boots, whips and Wesley revolvers,  temples in jungles, and the ever present threat of traps, animals and the occasional Nazi. This is the glamorous ideal of the Mysterium, the dashing adventurer off to secure ancient relics of Atlantis before they fall into the hands of an enemy. The flip side is the spidery scribe dipping an archaic quill into a well of India ink before they laboriously transcribe a tome that will never make the New York Best Sellers list. Again, the image is vivid; the skeletal like hands, the drawn pale skin, and the knowledge hidden behind blank eyes that have seen and read too much. The Mysterium is both, and neither, it is an order dedicated to the supernal, to the secrets hidden within, and the understanding that knowledge is power, it should be hidden wisely.%0a> %0a> The Mysterium, like the Adamantine Arrow, the Guardians of the Veil and the Silver Ladder trace their roots to Atlantis, to a time before the sundering of the realms. Before the celestial ladder was shattered and the Awakened were driven from their flawed Utopia, the Mysterium questioned, they researched and experimented with the arcane, the sublime and the supernal. In this their role has not changed, they still seek the mysteries, the answers, and the additional questions that their research provokes. But, the Mysterium has evolved; they now protect the secrets of the Supernal as much as the Guardians of the Veil. They covet relics of the past; they seek to collect the fragments of a long forgotten time. And, unknown to most orders, what the Mysterium cannot collect they are often times willing to destroy.  For every curator in the Mysterium there is also a member who is willing to be a thief, a procurer of goods in legal and illegal manners. Some members wear the façade of the scholar while also being a sometimes assassin; the pen truly becomes mightier than the sword with these members. %0a> %0a> There are those in the Mysterium who are completely content to avoid politics, to ponder a question, or a series of thoughts, until they find an enlightenment that they can share with others. Others are as dangerous in the political arts as any of the other orders.  Some stay quiet, recluses and hermits, they shun contact with others because their magic is their art and they are dedicated in protecting their art. There are the researchers and supernal scientists practicing forgotten rituals and rites, there are the laymen and women who do what needs to be done to keep the Order organized and functioning. The Mysterium, like the other orders, is everything said about it, and nothing. Their secrets are well kept, well hidden. Their practices are steeped in tradition and history, they are the lore masters and keepers of history, always with an eye to finding hidden truths even as they hide other information for their own safe keeping.%0a> %0a>  [--%25color=#365776%25[[#top| Back to top]]--]%0a> %0a> [[#TM-P]]%0a> !!!Playing a Mysterium%0a> The Mysties are not always super-secret bookworms that speak in riddles and Walken-esque tangents. They are like any other order, diverse and driven with a combination of order and personal goals. They have an interest in knowledge that is shared, but its interpretation is a personal one. The Mysterium is organized, very organized as one might suspect. Positions carry weight, and the access to further mysteries is strictly governed. Those who perform are rewarded, but with each reward come more responsibility, and more questions. The Mysterium seeks… that is the best way to say it. They seek, but what they seek is just part of the secret of being a member of the Mysterium.%0a> %0a> It is safe to say that mental skills are highly valued by the Mysterium. But that is just a little too easy. The ability to communicate is balanced with the ability to research. Patience is more than a virtue with the Mysterium, it is a requirement. Many of the younger members take time in learning this skill, but it is one that will serve them well during their time as a Mystie.  Something the Mysterium player must remember is that not everyone will want to question, want to look for the hidden secret or the obscure fact. During these times it comes down to those Mysterium members who are strong enough to influence others to assert themselves. Mysterium member must have the potential to lead, especially in times where their skills are the best use to the party. They need to know when silence and reserve must be put on the shelf and action must occur. Those are the Mysterium characters that will catch the eyes of others, both inside and outside of their orders.%0a> %0a>  [--%25color=#365776%25[[#top| Back to top]]--]%0a> %0a> [[#TM-S]]%0a> !!!Mysterium Setting%0a> The Mysterium waits, patiently, watching all that happens and recording what needs to be remembered. Well, what they deem needs to be remembered might be a better way of saying it. The Order has been an institution in Savannah, it is not exactly sure if it was the Mysterium or the Adamantine Arrow that first sought out the area now known as Savannah. If ‘‘Hattan’’ was not a Mysterium then it was those member of the Mysterium  arriving to study his work, and staying to complete  their  own work, that has made this Order  the longest active member of the Diamond in Savannah. %0a> %0a> During the trouble five years ago, it was ‘’Aislin’’, Curator and Senior Daduchos, who accused, and provided evidence against, ‘‘Titus’’ of the Silver Ladder. The then Hierarch was accused of aiding those forces that had all but destroyed the Guardians of the Veil. It was also ‘‘Aislin’’ who offered the seat of the Hierarch to the Free Council’s ‘‘Heron’’ instead of to the then hierophant ‘’Mariannas’’. What some believed was soon to be a schism within the Mysterium ended up becoming a cliché when ‘‘Mariannas’’ announced his retirement before subsequently vanishing from Savannah. It was… of course, a Mystery, and no one in then order seemed to know why ‘’Mariannas’’ retired as he did. %0a> %0a> When ‘‘Heron’’ suggested ‘‘Siafu’’ for the position of Hierarch it was ‘‘Aislin’’ who supported the idea without a pause even as she assumed the now vacant hierophant’s position within the Mysterium. If there was dissention or grumbling, it was never voiced, the Mysterium did not seem to miss a beat as a; war ended, one Hierarch was sacked and another installed and the leadership of their Order changed hands in the space of hours. The Mysterium displayed its ability to play politics, ‘‘Aislin’’ appeared to be a kingmaker in the mold of the Silver Ladder, but she did not push whatever agenda she had by suggesting -Heron.- Since that time ‘‘Aislin’’ has quietly supported the Hierarch, but the warmth between the two seems strained at best. Perhaps this is why the  Mysterium has preferred to let its councilors act in the interest of the Consilium instead of moving as an Order. %0a> %0a> The strongest bond the Mysterium has currently is with the Free Council, though that is not saying much. The Free Council spent some time trying to prove their self-stylized manner of an Assembly nee Consilium was correct, only to find out the amount of work it took to balance out the different orders. The Mysterium has never actually said, “ We told you so,” but the looks and the occasional comment tell the true story. With the Silver Ladder, there is a cold peace, the ousting of ‘‘Titus’’ and the besmirching of the Silver Ladder’s pride, even for the “right” reasons has strained relations between the orders. The Mysterium and the Guardians of the Veil have never been close, those who keep secrets tend to have a hard time making friends with others who keep secrets. Finally, the relationship with the Arrow is, odd at best. ‘‘Kreig’’ and ‘‘Aislin’’ do not dislike one another, nor do they like one another, there is some wedge between the order, a wedge neither side is willing to speak on.%0a> %0a> For now the Mysterium works on various projects, most of which are hidden away from the prying eyes of other awakened. Some projects are even obfuscated from members within the order, their secret reserved for those who are needed for their abilities. This is, of course, the nature of the Mysterium, the nature of an order built around the concepts of information and knowledge. Projects aside, the Savannah Mysterium is rumored as having one of the greatest vaults of items, artifacts, and pieces of knowledge on the Eastern Seaboard. The Athenaeum supposedly boasts a treasure trove hidden away and moderated by curators and acquisitors, sometimes growing, being traded with others for different relics. The Mysterium members stay busy, and are often known to develop some impressive frequent flyer miles. And then there is also rumor that there has been a break through on -Hattan’s- project, a deciphering of purpose and meaning that will change the face of the awakened landscape. %0a> %0a>  [--%25color=#365776%25[[#top| Back to top]]--]%0a> %0a> [[#TM-OS]]%0a> !!!Mysterium Order Status%0a> Make sure you have taken a look at the status primer as it will give you the overview for the entire venue.

When looking to advance you will be required to understand and define what these ideals mean in game for you. It will take a little bit of writing, but you do not have to write a novella. Also, you will not have to write on each subject, when looking to advance you will be given a selection of these ideals and you need to format them in a way that is congruent to how you have been playing your character.

Sleepwalkers can attain this rank and prepare themselves for the future.%0a> %0a> :Status 1 Senior Neokoros: Those who have not found specific roles within the Mysterium still have a value as the Senior Neokoros. They guide the initiates and the sleepwalkers, ready to advance themselves and the Mysterium they serve.%0a> %0a> :Status 1 Acquisitor:It's dangerous work, dirty work, but it is a popular position, These are your tomb raiders, your Indian Jones’s. These are the Mysterium members willing to travel, willing to throw their bodies and minds on the line in the search for artifact and relic, for tome and for knowledge. Some are thieves, others are called worse, but their role is clear, first dibs on whatever they find.%0a> %0a> :Status 1 Censor: Imagine the Guardians of the Veil branch of the Mysterium. When the Acuqisitor is off pursuing fame and treasure it is the censor who must do what dirty work remains. Censors do just as their name suggests, they censor the use of dangerous artifacts and knowledge, procuring it, hiding it, and sometimes even destroying it. Whether it is a device, a page of forgotten lore, or a person, the censor must have the iron will and the belief that what they do is for the better of all awakened.%0a> %0a> :Status 2 Daduchos: Meaning “torch Bearer” the Daduchos is the rank of the teaching branch of the Mysterium. These are the Awakened who guide the Neokoros and the daily function in a Mysterium’s Caucus.  This rank must be attained before being considered for a Savant role.%0a> %0a> :Status 2 Savant: The true record keepers, the savants live in two worlds, the occult and the mundane, coalescing theories and studies and recording them as best they can. They catalogue, the write, but most importantly, a savant is required to remember /everything/ they do. This is a hard position to attain, harder still to keep as some information should never be remembered.%0a> %0a> :Status 3 Senior Daduchos: Before becoming a Curator a Mage must first attain Senior Daduchos. These are the Mysterium who are challenging myths, searching for more esoteric and hidden lore.%0a> %0a> :Status 3 Curator: A patient and learned individual, the Curator is often the respected advisor as well and the personnel manager of the Mysterium. They organize Athenaeums, they promote the Mysterium values both in and out of the order. They are active in the Consilium but avoid the normal power plays and overt signs of action. They are politicians, and at times, even warriors in the social arena.  At times they marshal resources, organize and arrange the troops, other times they wait, patiently, until they are needed.%0a> %0a> :Status 4-5 Hierophant: The head of the order, the vision and the focus of the Mysterium caucus. Representing the order to the Consilium, the Hierophant has mastered certain secrets, finding out that there is no end to the mysteries to be solved.%0a> %0a>  [--%25color=#365776%25[[#top| Back to top]]--]%0a> %0a> [[#SL]]%0a> !!The Silver Ladder%0a> %25lfloat text-align=center margin-top=5px margin-right=15px margin-bottom=5px margin-left=0px%25http://wantonwicked.gamingsandbox.com/wiki/images/mta/symbols/mta_logo_sl.png%0a> The politician, the activist, and the manic street preacher telling you the end is nigh. It could be the bullhorn in a crowd causing the mob to surge and swell  or a preacher standing above a congregation, every word spreading faith and devotion. The Silver Ladder is often thought of as the blue blood aristocracy of the Pentacle, but the truth is far different than the fiction. Some of the members of the Ladder claim a heritage lost in the time since Atlantis, but no Ladder living today can draw a direct pedigree back to the founding families of the ancient city. The role of the Silver Ladder is that of a leader of people, their role is that of service for the Awakened and the sleeping world.  They are the spreaders of vision, of counsel and the scions of those ancients who believed in action. For ages the Silver Ladder has been the backbone of the organization of the pentacle, before the Free Council existed, it was the Ladder who proliferated a vision of the future, the need to evolve, to adapt, and to lead the sleeping world to an Awakened nation. Even now, the members of the Ladder regularly find themselves in the roles of counselors for the wise and the leaders of the Awakened. %0a> %0a> Some Ladders lead in Battle, as dangerous and cunning as their Adamantine Arrow Counterparts, others lead through education, as wise and knowing as members of the Mysterium. Many would like to think of the Silver Ladder as little more than popinjays puffed up with self-importance, and sadly some Ladders will fit this bill, but to be a Silver Ladder one must have a confidence that, to some, boarders on arrogance. Self-assurance that their cause is right, that their purpose is just, this is a hallmark of a Silver Ladder. Some might call it hubris, a hubris that goes back prior to the forging of the celestial ladder that would be the doom on Atlantis. These naysayers are the opponents of the Silver Ladder not because of their own investment, they are antagonists fed on the propaganda and muddled history of the other orders and the non-believers. The Ladder call hubris a cowards ward, a thin façade that the Awakened who cannot lead, who cannot “do,” hide behind. %0a> %0a> Seen by many as the pretender kings or as elitist, the Silver Ladder is thought as an anachronistic organization, especially to those of the Free Council. However, it has been the mission of the Silver Ladder to guide the Awakened in their goal to tap into the supernal mysteries. The Silver Ladder fights to remember the past, not to dwell in it, a part that is often overlooked by other orders. A silver Ladder is aware of his or her Order’s pedigree, but understands that it is the acts of the Silver Ladder today that guide the future. Some lead from the Hierarch’s seat, others as trusted advisor of wizened councilor. The role of a Ladder is not easy, constantly challenged by what some call progress the modern Silver Ladder must be part statesman, part warrior, and part sage. The Ladder is not for the weak of heart, mind or soul.%0a> %0a>  [--%25color=#365776%25[[#top| Back to top]]--]%0a> %0a> [[#SL-P]]%0a> !!!Playing a Silver Ladder%0a> The ladder sometimes is thought of as the “invictus” ( for you pointy toof players) of the Mage game. Some people do try to play the Ladder in this manner, but that is limiting in many ways. Mages do not respond to the power of ancient families when they have the same amount of power themselves. Blue blood spills as fast are red and white collars can be toppled by blue. The silver Ladder should be the role of a leader, or of a trusted advisor. These characters are more than boardroom executives who move pieces on a phantasmal chessboard. The Silver Ladder rewards leading from the front, helming the course of the Awakened nation in the form of a Consilium or a Cabal as well as providing leadership and counsel to the mortals who still slumber. %0a> The skills for a Ladder will be varied,  but expression and the ability to communicate are key. Whether a scholar, or a preacher denouncing the sins of the flesh and alcohol on a campus, the Ladder character must be able to communicate. This is not to say there are not warriors among the Ladder, the warrior caste, for a lack of a better term, is versed in combat that could include sword or a pen. Sometimes more is done with a word or a signature than even an army could accomplish, and the Silver Ladder player should remember this. Ladders are meant to be dynamic individuals, with great risk comes great reward.%0a> %0a>  [--%25color=#365776%25[[#top| Back to top]]--]%0a> %0a> [[#SL-S]]%0a> !!!Silver Ladder Setting%0a> A punch drunk prize fighter clinging to the ropes , the ten count echoing in their ears, taking minutes, years to process as they struggle to stand once again. This is the Silver Ladder of Savannah. Their reign had been long, their reign had been great, too great, and then they paid a price. The decimation of a pentacle member was laid at their feet. Their leader, the leader of the city, of the Consilium was charged with aiding and abetting. Suddenly the losses of another Order became their burden, their Lament as the once bright star of the Magisters was run out of town and the order was left leaderless. That was the hubris, the price of folly and arrogance that was paid by the Silver Ladder. Their faith in ‘‘Titus’’ made them weak, made his brilliance a Panacea for all that would ail the order. Once he was gone, the remaining members of the order were left to fend for themselves. %0a> %0a> It took some time, but the order finally looked into the mirror and remembered what it is. The Free Council, under ‘‘Heron’’ Was merciless for the first two years after the near destruction of the Guardians. Every mistake made by the Ladder was a reminder of ‘‘Titus’’ and his failure, the Ladder was hammered in the Consilium, its pride continually shattered as a price for their failure. The Free Council became the institution and ‘‘Heron’’ appeared to gloat during his greatest triumph.%0a> %0a> Then there was change. A new Ladder entered the city three years ago, ‘’Alsace’’, Lictor and Factotum of the Silver Ladder, she arrived like acanthi sometimes do, at exactly the right time. She engaged ‘‘Heron’’ openly, arguing the Lex, pointing out that she was not part of the Consilium during the troubles, and that the law was blind to the orders, it was written for all Awakened, all members of the pentacle. ‘‘Heron’’ found himself having to work against this Ladder and the lambasting of the Silver Ladder, and the constant reminder of the near destruction waned against this new bastion, one who could play politics with a silver tongue or a hidden knife.%0a> %0a> With ‘‘Alsace’’ drawing the attention of the Consilium, primarily the Free Council, to herself, Claviger ‘‘Decimus’’ began the reorganization of the Silver Ladder. It was true, they had relied on ‘‘Titus’’ too much, put all their supernal eggs in one basket. Their cryptopolies had been shattered and had dispersed in the two years since ‘‘Titus’’ left. Some saw this as a sign that ‘‘Titus’’ truly was deserving of the accusations against him, other saw it as the scattering of evidence of his innocence. Whatever it was the ladder regrouped, they rebuilt, and now their toes are dug into the ground and they are ready to push back into the Consilium, to retake their place. The Free Council’s dream of assembly didn’t work, the Consilium remains a Consilium, and it is a playing field that the Silver Ladder can finally level, perhaps erasing the stain left on their name.%0a> %0a> Right now the Ladder is coldest with the Free Council, but there should be no surprise. The Free Council has adopted the Hubris Mantle, treating their victory by continuously reminding the vanquished of their mistake. Their day will come, the scales will be balanced, and all debts will be paid. The relationship with the arrow is interesting. It is not warm, it is not cold., ‘‘Kreig’’ does not appear to share in the joy ‘‘Heron’’ has had in tormenting the Ladder, but he has not supported them either. Perhaps he is watching to see if they are willing to stand back up on their own two feet, if so, the attitude might change. With the Mysterium, the Ladder holds a silent grudge. It was ‘‘Aislin’’ who named ‘‘Titus’’ as a conspirator, but the evidence was never clear, there was no trial, for a moment the Lex was forgotten and passions swept through the Consilium, something has never set right because of that. And then, with the Guardians of the Veil… it is interesting, for orders that most often come to political blows the Guardians of the Veil has left the ladder be, ‘‘Siafu’’ does not say much in most cases, but says even less about the Ladder, yet the Guardians of the Veil have not stopped any progress made by the Ladder even when they had opportunity to do so.%0a> %0a> The Ladder is crawling up the ropes, bloodied but unbowed. Now is the time that they shake off the rust and the ringing in their ears as they step back into the fight. They will learn how string they are when the next punch lands.%0a> %0a>  [--%25color=#365776%25[[#top| Back to top]]--]%0a> %0a> [[#SL-OS]]%0a> !!!Silver Ladder Order Status%0a> Make sure you have taken a look at the status primer as it will give you the overview for the entire venue. This portion will be broken down into two distinct parts. The status in the order and the status in the Consilium:%0a> %0a> To gain status in the order begins with what is covered in the status primer. Forward the goals of the Silver Ladder whether in the Consilium or the mundane world. Lead from the front, by example, and forward understanding of the Silver Ladder precepts, order goals and mandates. Find and develop ways to encourage mortals to awaken, lead or guide mundane institutions to better themselves and push for their Supernal birthright. At times Silver Ladders will be judged on how they are perceived by others, for better and for worse. Sometimes antagonism is good when it causes positive action. %0a> %0a> Following the establishment of the Consilium, following the Lex Magica and making others see the wisdom of the Lex is also considered when thinking of status. The Ladder cannot be passive in their actions and expect others to notice. Sometimes a velvet glove must cover and iron fist. The Silver ladder follows what are called the Elemental precepts. They are broken down like so:%0a> %0a>  [--%25color=#365776%25[[#top| Back to top]]--]%0a> %0a> [[#SL-CS]]%0a> !!!Silver Ladders and Consilium Status%0a> A member of the Silver Ladder gains status in the Consilium by performing Consilium required tasks, many of which will parallel tasks assigned by the order. One of the most important investments of the Silver Ladder is the Lex Magica, so strengthening and defending the Lex is a consistent example of how the Silver Ladder can serve in the Consilium. Acting as Councilors, heads of Cabals, and supporting the Organization of the Consilium along more traditional lines is a way to gain status. Also serving in various positions or functions are ways for enterprising characters to gain status in the Consilium.%0a> %0a>  [--%25color=#365776%25[[#top| Back to top]]--]%0a> %0a> [[#SL-Pr]]%0a> !!!Precepts of the Silver Ladder%0a> The Diamond Precept:%0a> 	The Awakened are One Nation%0a> 	Enemies of Unity - those who are enemies of the Awakened Nation%0a> 	Hieraconis - The Nation yet to come%0a> The precept of Thunder:%0a> 	Imperium is the Right of Man%0a> 	The Stag, The Lion, The Sage - The roles of the Silver Ladder%0a> 	Inspiring Power%0a> The Precept of the Star%0a> 	The Silver Ladder is the Path To Victory%0a> 	Spirituality%0a> 	Law and Justice%0a> 	Government%0a> The Precept of Blood%0a> 	The Sleepers Follow%0a> 	Religion%0a> 	Politics%0a> 	Secret Societies%0a> %0a> %0a>  [--%25color=#365776%25[[#top| Back to top]]--]%0a> %0a> [[#SL-Pos]]%0a> !!!Positions in the Silver Ladder%0a> :Status 0-1 Acolyte: The initiated and the new. These members of the Silver Ladder have begun their elemental pilgrimage and they stand ready to take the steps that will lead them to a greater understanding of themselves. To attain status 1 an Acolyte should have decided which precept they are going to follow and then they will begin to develop their relationships inside and outside of the Ladder.%0a> %0a> :Status 2 Lictor, Factotum, Acolyte (Superior):The acolyte is still an acolyte with status two, though they have developed a reputation or some form of clout. They Silver Ladder ought to be beginning their cryptopoly by now, or focusing on other aspects of the Silver Ladder. These other aspects could be the Factotum position, a position covered in more depth (here.) The Factotum is a student and a specialist in the Lex Magica, they are often the ones who add amendments to a Consilium’s Lex and are sought after as advisors. The Lictor, which is a rare position is a travelling ladder who prosecutes the Lex in times of dire need. They have special exemptions regarding the Lex. Few Lictors are not also qualified Factotums. To gain the status of Lictor will take serious work in game, and one will need to have the Silver Ladder supplement to fully understand the character requirements.%0a> %0a> :Status 3 Claviger: The Claviger is a role that requires a character to put Order business and mandate before all else. They are expected to understand all of the elemental precepts and how they affect the Consilium and the mortal world. They are teachers, mentors and the guides to newly awakened Ladders. Often times Clavigers are the emissaries to the Consilium and other awakened when it is not expedient to use Heralds. These ambassador duties could include dealing with ghosts, spirits, and in the event of dealing with other supernatural creatures, it is the Claviger’s duties to forward the goals of the Silver Ladder.%0a> %0a> :Status 4 Deacon: The position of Deacon is actually a sacrifice, it is the suppressing of personal desire to plumb the Supernal mysteries to serve the Silver Ladder. Deacons define the role of an order in a city, and represent their city in larger congregations.  The Deacon is often a master in some way, but not always, sometimes it is a person of rare vision and dedication who can attain this role.%0a> %0a> Part of gaining status in the Silver Ladder is the formation of Cryptopolies. There will be a longer post on what these are, and what they might entail will take up its own post.%0a> %0a>  [--%25color=#365776%25[[#top| Back to top]]--]%0a

The threats to the Awakened world are numerous. From the Awakened servants of the Exarchs known as the Seers of the Throne (those dedicated to enslaving the sleeping world with the denial of their supernal birthright,) to the Banishers (the mistaken pariah of their Awakened brethren who seek to eradicate those who are Awakened… including themselves,) the Adamantine Arrow contests with others whose knowledge of the Supernal makes them a most dangerous foe. If this were not enough there are other threats, non-human threats that hunt and haunt the Awakened.  Abyssal  entities which force their way into this plane, the summoned avatars of other realms who break their conjurors’ hold and run rampant in the mundane world, the spirits and ghosts, automatons and more, each one a threat that the Adamantine Arrow is expected to face. Lastly, there are sleepers, humans, who would hunt the Awakened, dangerous individual who have not seen the truth behind the lie, yet threaten the existence of the Awakened people. The Adamantine Arrows is a proud order, taking their roles in the continued survival of the Awakened with a seriousness that is only found in the warrior heroes of the ancient epics.%0a%3c %0a%3c The Adamantine Arrows are warriors, but like all squares are rectangles and not all rectangles are squares the Arrow display their roles as a warrior in different ways. Some, yes some are inheritors of the military culture, the solider and sailor, the trained and disciplined Awakened who has spent years learning a mortal craft only to apply it to their Awakened State. They are also the athlete and the martial artist, the dedicated and conditioned mind that is focused and able to understand order and training. There are the politicians, the educated, and the students who learn and develop tactics and strategies to employ against the enemies of the awakened. There are the artists, the creators, the ones who work at the supernal smithies, forging items that some Arrows must use to defeat the greatest of threats. The Adamantine Arrow is not one dimensional, though many cannot see through the wall of warriors to find the apparatus that keeps all militaries running. %0a%3c %0a%3c The Adamantine Arrow will always be defined by their relationship to conflict, it is central to their existence, their being. But conflict happens every day in the mundane world, often happening without a shot being fired. The political battlefield is as brutal and demanding as the sands of the Middle East.  The Adamantine Arrow seeks to protect the Awakened, and itself as an Order, against any threat, and there is constant vigilance, a constancy of purpose, and continued acceptance of the challenges place before them. Conflict is eternal, the conflict is life, whether it is mastering a skill or sighting an enemy in the crosshairs of a weapon, the Arrow strive to remain in a constant state of action, life is defined by conflict.%0a%3c  [--%25color=#365776%25[[#top| Back to top]]--]%0a%3c %0a%3c [[#AA-P]]%0a%3c !!!Playing an Adamantine Arrow%0a%3c %0a%3c The arrow is much more varied than the core lets on. The Adamantine Arrow is not simply a “break glass in case of war” order. They compete amongst themselves, they compete against the Consilium and they compete, in many ways, against the sleeping world. When thinking of a concept for an Arrow, realize that no army is without an infrastructure, a bureaucracy, and its politicians. Sometimes the most important person in the battle is the one who can position the troops in the right place at the right time. %0a%3c %0a%3c The skills you take as an Arrow will be varied, but you should include at least one fighting style. Stamina is more important than brute force for the Adamantine Arrow for a multitude of reasons; one of the most important reasons is stamina defines how many spells can be cast on your character (by your character or by others) before you take a negative modifier(s) as your pattern frays/overloads. When you pick you skills think of your concept and work up from there. A scout doesn’t necessarily have to be the combat wombat; they may prefer never to be seen instead using arcana to enhance mundane abilities. The strategist will be higher mental than the politician who will need social combat skills. Remember, the Arrow is not all “Rawr, Kill.” What some do with a sword others will do with a knife and still others do with a word. You have flexibility here.%0a%3c %0a%3c  [--%25color=#365776%25[[#top| Back to top]]--]%0a%3c %0a%3c [[#AA-S]]%0a%3c !!!Adamantine Arrow Setting%0a%3c "You see it all around us, Consilium after Consilium seeing our service to the Awakened as some form of conscription into a supernal army. More than one councilor, more than one Hierarch has thrown us in harm's way with little in the way of support, or worry, for our own safety. We are the Adamantine Arrow, we are not mindless machines that are to be used at the whim of those who think they know better. In the past, you may have expected blind submission to the word of the Consilium. That was the past. We, the Adamantine Arrow will continue to serve the Consilium of Consilium, but we will never again serve blindly; and because you have wasted our goodwill, we will no longer serve for free." ‘‘Kreig’’ addressing ‘’Titus’’, Silver Ladder Hierarch and the Savannah Consilium, August 2002%0a%3c %0a%3c The Arrow of Savannah are under the guidance of Adamant Sage ‘’Krieg’’ and the Arrows exist in an odd nervous détente with the other orders. ‘’Krieg’’ has seen the Adamantine Arrow used as the meat shield for politicos in times of war, only to be discarded or made into pariahs for the zeal they use to defend a Consilium. ‘‘Kreig’’ left his previous Consilium over a decade ago, disgusted with the way the Arrow was treated, and what was worse, the way the Arrow accepted this treatment… Krieg refused to let this happen again. %0a%3c %0a%3c The Arrow is almost mercenary in regards to a mustering of a full order. When other orders need the use of specific Arrows, then there is a price for their service. While Krieg does not require Arrows who have joined cabals to charge a tithe to their cabal mates, but when specialists are needed there is always a fee. This, in no uncertain terms, makes the Consilium nervous because what Krieg is doing is not against the Lex in any way, and it would appear that they have no choice but to acquiesce to the way the Order is run. ‘’Krieg’’ has created “fire-teams” that respond to various problems. Starting with the bare minimum of two Arrows, because an Arrow never serves alone, the fire teams operate to support Consilium and Order goals. From this basic unit the Fire Teams can grow in size to up to eight Arrows working in conjunction and often under a First Talon or a brevetted First Talon for an operation. While operational “command” of these units can be under the leadership of another Awakened, strategic and tactical command always resides in the hands of the ranking Arrow or the deal is not agreed to. %0a%3c %0a%3c Right now there is loyalty to the Consilium, but at what price? The relationship with the Guardians of the Veil is neutral to oddly friendly; the Order respects the position the Guardians of the Veil, seeing them as survivors in way. Despite public opposition to the order, ‘‘Kreig’’ appears to support their current mission. The relationship with the Silver Ladder is … cool, each Order seeming to respect the other and not looking to enforce their internal policies on another. The relationship with the Free Council is strained, the Arrow disagreeing with the way the “victors” have treated other orders with the upheaval in the past. To the Mysterium, it is hard to tell, it is a political relationship that is hard to judge and to which Krieg has said little about.%0a%3c %0a%3c The Arrow are not perfect, the conflict that they encounter and keep in their lives defies the use of this word, but they are organized and they are unified to the outside eye. ‘’Krieg’s’’ subordinates support his methods in public, and in private there is no talk of dissention. The fact that he has promised and kept his word on how he perceives the order has bought him loyalty as a leader that is fierce among the First Talons and the Thunderbolt Guardian. This is not to say he cannot be questioned, questioning and revolution are part of the Phalanxes, but so far, the questions have been few. ‘’Krieg’’ does not hold himself above the mandates he has set, anyone can challenge his leadership… all they have to do is face him in single combat.%0a%3c %0a%3c [--%25color=#365776%25[[#top| Back to top]]--]%0a%3c %0a%3c [[#AA-OS]]%0a%3c !!!Adamantine Arrow Order Status%0a%3c Make sure you have taken a look at the status primer as it will give you the overview for the entire venue. This portion will be broken down into two distinct parts. The status in the order and the status in the Consilium:%0a%3c %0a%3c To gain status in the order begins with what is covered in the status primer. Forward the goals of the arrows. Contest and conquer objectives as defined by the Adamant Sage or a Ranking Arrow. In combat defeat the enemy if that is the goal, capture if commanded to do so. Never abandon another Arrow in the field, and confrontation with other Arrows is /ALWAYS/ done behind closed does. To the rest of the Consilium, the Arrow is one, pissing contests and jockeying for position is never discussed in front of others. One does not talk about Fight Club. %0a%3c %0a%3c Defending the order from attacks, both from the enemies of the Consilium and the Consilium itself is part of the way to gain status. Another way is to forward your understanding of the Arrow and its ways. In the Adamantine Arrow supplement there are core ideals called the [[#AA-Ph|Phalanxes]].%0a%3c %0a%3c [--%25color=#365776%25[[#top| Back to top]]--]%0a%3c %0a%3c [[#AA-CS]]%0a%3c !!!Adamantine Arrows and Consilium Status%0a%3c An Arrow can gain status in the Consilium by performing Consilium required tasks, many of which will parallel tasks assigned by the order. Defending the Consilium in times of war, persecuting the enemies in a fashion hat upholds the integrity and the stability of the Consilium, being a presence in the event members of other Consili visit. These are easy ways for the common arrow to rise in some stature. There are other ways, such as taking active roles in the Consilium that the Arrow is part of these roles can include Councilor or Provost to a cabal, the position of Sentinel or of Herald. Also, for enterprising players the character could learn from another order, taking order specific titles (such as the Silver Ladder Factotum [lawyer of the Lex]) as a way to represent the adaptability of the Arrow as an order. The positions of the Consilium and of other order will be discussed in other posts.

If you have the book you are willing to read the information there, but more importantly, you will define these concepts in your character’s terms. When looking to advance you will be required to understand and define what these ideals mean in game for you. It will take a little bit of writing, but you do not have to write a novella. Also, you will not have to write on each subject, when looking to advance you will be given a selection of these ideals and you need to format them in a way that is congruent to how you have been playing your character.

Welcome to fight club.%0a%3c %0a%3c :Status 1 Banner Warden: An Arrow who has proven their worth and has joined a cabal can earn the title  of Banner Warden. They, in essence, become the champion for the cabal, accepting duels and often becoming the second in command in a cabal. In formal situations, it is the Banner Warden who carries the “arms” or the “heraldry” of the cabal when meeting others. (Side note, normally  order responsibilities are lessened on a Banner Warden as the Arrow respects their commitment to a cabal.)%0a%3c %0a%3c :Status 2 First Talon: An Arrow reaching First Talon is now “officer” status, they can command in the field and are usually being groomed in other forms of combat than their natural battlefield. A politician begins to learn more hand to hand, a combat mage begins to develop more tactics. These are the “doers” in the Order.%0a%3c %0a%3c :Status 3 Thunderbolt Guardian: To many the Thunderbolt Guardian is seen as a higher ranking officer, but in practice the Thunderbolt Guardian is supposed to be the teacher or mentor to other arrows as they continue their conflict. At this level they are also the specialists, if a Talon is the infantry then Thunderbolt Guardians are Delta. After the First Talon has learned to broaden their abilities it is the Thunderbolt Guardian who then relearns a focus and specialty.%0a%3c %0a%3c :Status 4+  The Adamant Sage: More than a general, the Adamant Sage is a force. They are often times masters of multiple arcana; they have honed their focus as a Thunderbolt Guardian to transcend practice into art. They are pinnacles of the Arrow, and are often counselors to the Consilium in more ways than just in times of war. The Adamant Sage is the Vision of the Arrow in an area, they are required to be more than just powerful Awakened, and they are to balance their supernal with mundane skills and abilities as well.%0a%3c %0a%3c  [--%25color=#365776%25[[#top| Back to top]]--]%0a%3c %0a%3c  [[#FC]]%0a%3c !!The Free Council%0a%3c %25lfloat text-align=center margin-top=5px margin-right=15px margin-bottom=5px margin-left=0px%25http://wantonwicked.gamingsandbox.com/wiki/images/mta/symbols/mta_logo_fc.png%0a%3c “We want the world and we want it now!” Famous lyrics from a song that half of this generation would never recognize amid the auto-tuned synth-pop that is mass marketed and fed to the youth like genetically altered feed to cows. This is the Free Council, the revolution with a cause that is the sword of Damocles poised above the throats of the wise. Escape the past, leave the shackles of failure and of Atlantis and strive to the future. This is part of the perception of the Free Council. To some the Libertines are little more than raving lunatics, fanatics bent on taking the history and the tradition of Atlantis and trading upon it in some fevered lemming rush to a supposed Democratic Utopia. If it were that easy then maybe the landscape of the Pentacle would have changed.%0a%3c %0a%3c It’s never that easy.%0a%3c %0a%3c Yes, there are those who fit the mold of the anarchist, the revolutionary, and they martyr…never forget the martyrs. But there are also the teachers, the educators, the historians and those who seek to build on the mistakes of the past to provide for a better future. To some, the only difference between the Free Council and the Silver Ladder is public relations and press coverage. The Free Council do look to the future, often time chafing at the plodding of the Diamond in its slow trek to Ascension.  The Free Council is made up of as many half-truths as any of the other orders. The Free Council is not free, and it is not exactly a Council. Without organization the libertines would have never succeeded in formulating their own order, without sacrifice and adherence to as many mandates and policies as the other order the Order would have crumbled under its own weight. The cogs of progress are lubricated with the ideals of the visionaries, but the pathway to hell is coated in their good intentions.%0a%3c %0a%3c To be a Libertine is to understand an internal conflict, to strive for a future set on the ruins of the past. Instead of blind ambition the rose colored glasses of idealism are often the most common possession of many a Libertine’s satchel of useful tools. Belief in the future of all awakened, belief that something better is still to come; these are some of the hallmarks of the Libertines. Derision to those stuck in the past, a jester’s mocking of the king, the conflict of the Free Council and the Atlantean Orders is not a war. There must be someone willing to question the past, someone willing to use it to light the future. When the other orders develop tunnel vision based on myth it is the Free Council’s job to light the fire, to burn away superstition and show what potential awaits the Awakened nation.%0a%3c %0a%3c Activist, politician, teacher, conspiracy theorist, anyone can be a member of the Free Council. Some will teach, others will learn. Some will lead and others will follow. The Free Council is not an army of mindless revolutionaries, instead they are a group of Awakened that know the best is yet to come.%0a%3c %0a%3c  [--%25color=#365776%25[[#top| Back to top]]--]%0a%3c %0a%3c [[#FC-P]]%0a%3c !!!Playing a Libertine%0a%3c Like any other order, there are stereotypes. “Revolution Calling” is not just a song by Queensryche, it is a prevailing concept in the Free Council and the application of this thought is as different as the members who make up the Order. The Free Council looks to tomorrow, some do so blindly, regardless of the lessons of the past. Some look forward with peril to their soul, their health, their integrity. Others carefully plot their course, looking to play the game of the Awakened, politicians as ruthless and cunning as any found in the Diamond. These are the heralds of the future, or so they would have you believe, and some actually live up to the billing.%0a%3c %0a%3c The skills needed by the Free Council cannot be quantified as an order. A scientist is not the same as a student; a revolutionary is not the same as a martyr.  Dedication to the cause can appear in a myriad of ways that are customizable to the character being played. In some ways physical stats will be important if a Libertine is going the might makes right route, to others it will be social or mental attributes and skills that are prized.  Try not to pigeon hold you Libertine with the thought that everything must happen now, look for the long game, the future is coming no matter what you say or do. It is up to the Free Council to try and shape it to be better than the past.%0a%3c %0a%3c  [--%25color=#365776%25[[#top| Back to top]]--]%0a%3c %0a%3c [[#FC-S]]%0a%3c !!!Free Council Setting%0a%3c Becoming the norm is a bitch, becoming the institution is even worse. The Free Council in Savannah is in an odd position; they appear to be in charge without having to sit in the big chair. The situation is convoluted to say the least, but it is a truth.%0a%3c %0a%3c Five years ago a pogrom against the Guardians of the Veil was laid at the Hierarch’s feet. Titus, a Silver Ladder, was run out of town under accusations of supporting the Abyss, the Seers, and about anyone else the Consilium could blame for the death of so many awakened. The apostate population was culled, even the Free Council wanted blood in those days. Afterwards the Consilium was wrecked, one order was decimated, and another was in shambles. It was at this time that -Heron,- the head of the Assembly in Savannah, was offered the Hierarch’s  position by the ranking members of the Mysterium. The Arrow didn’t want the spot, the Silver Ladder was stained by Titus and the accusations against him and the Guardians were in Shambles. %0a%3c %0a%3c In what can only be described as a “dick” move, ‘‘Heron’’ instead suggested that the Guardians would be safest if one of their members was Hierarch. In short, ‘‘Heron’’ sidestepped direct responsibility to the Consilium and forced a Guardian into a position they didn’t want. It was a coup, a Mask was now, in -Heron’s- mind, and impotent figurehead that had to stay in front of the eyes of the Consilium at all order when they had to run the Consilium.  ‘‘Heron’’ proved  himself to be an astute politician, one capable of leading without needing a title to do it and this act was just the beginning.%0a%3c %0a%3c In the last five years ‘‘Heron’’ has made sure that there is enough Consilium business to keep the masks weak in physical power. The Silver Ladder, yeah, they are recovering, but it is slow. The Ladder’s pride took the brunt of the damage and ‘‘Heron’’ is sometimes liberal in reminding the Magisters about this.  Following -Heron’s- lead, the Free Council took the opportunity to show the Ladder that living in the past, or what the Libertines see as the past, was not the way to go. %0a%3c %0a%3c How did they show the Silver Ladder that the old ways didn’t work, well, they stepped in and operated the Consilium how they thought it should be ran. In doing this they, the Free Council, became the institution; a shift they did not see coming and were, at first, not prepared to adapt to.  The Mysterium was not dabbling in politics, busy with their own pursuits,  and the Arrows were their normal quiet self under the leadership of ‘‘Kreig’’.  Suddenly the Free Council was doing all the leg work in the Consilium, a role that they had to take to prove the old ways were wrong and, initially, they seemed to be up to the task. There was some change, but over the course of the last five years the Libertines find themselves following the old methods, in regards to the Consilium, instead of forging new methods. To some this was lazy, to others it was what was needed. The Free Council seemed to lose some of its vision and there has been talk that ‘‘Heron’’ spends too much time resting on his laurels.%0a%3c %0a%3c The current state for the Free Council is the natural state of the Free Council, one of change, a flux caught in the moment right before it sparks. The Free Council has made some change happen, but they have also fallen into old habits. They are not the outcast order, they are not the young upstarts. Here in Savannah they are the institution, not as an Assembly for all Awakened, but as the current backbone of the Consilium. There are perks, the Free Council has been able to keep the Guardians in check, the Silver Ladder cowed and appear to have little in the way of opposition from the Arrows and the Mysterium. The problem, as some see it, is that the Free Council has a lot of what it wants… and no idea what to do with it. ‘‘Heron’’ leads the Free Council, but does not lead the Consilium. The work supporting the Consilium and the Awakened has fallen to the rank and file. %0a%3c %0a%3c It is hard to say if the revolution has ended, or if it is just beginning. The Consilium functions, the Assembly is still intact, though it is a majority of the Consilium now. And oddly enough, the Hierarch, a Guardian of the Veil has never stopped the Free Council from trying to make change, at times even supporting the Libertine cause and ideals. Strange times that, times that make many libertine question, “What’s next?”%0a%3c %0a%3c  [--%25color=#365776%25[[#top| Back to top]]--]%0a%3c %0a%3c [[#FC-OS]]%0a%3c !!!Free Council Order Status%0a%3c Make sure you have taken a look at the status primer as it will give you the overview for the entire venue.

Look to make change, look to forward the Order’s goals and mandates. Guide the Pentacle and show that the past was just that, the past, and the future is what will define the Awakened as a people.  Look to control resources that will help herald in the future, look to enact change in law, in procedure that affects and benefits the Pentacle. Fighting from within and without will make change.  %0a%3c %0a%3c Defending the order from subversion, from damaging rhetoric will help gain status. Becoming an example of what is to come, leading the change, these are ways to gain status.. Another way is to forward your understanding of the Free Council and its ways.

Expected to follow company policy, the Voter could be asked to jump through hoops before gaining this status, but once they are established, they serve to strengthen the Libertines by helping guide the order though their participation in the Assembly.%0a%3c Status 1-3- Emissary- Starting as a 1 dot status, the emissary is a common position within the Free Council. Like internal heralds, the emissary is a form of contact between estranged Consili and Free Council Assemblies. %0a%3c  %0a%3c :Status 1-3 Minutemen: These are the martial arm of the Free Council, those who are willing to fight, even die, for the cause. They serve the Assembly, and also can gain this status by fighting for a Consilium. To become a minuteman, the Voter must volunteer, and then they are considered in service to the Assembly in a military. Some would also say policemen.%0a%3c %0a%3c :Status 1-5 Syndic: Politicians to the core, these are the voice and the fire in the Free Council.  Equal parts charisma and chutzpah, these are the best and the worst of the free Council. They can lead, they can backstab, and they are a vocal piece of the free council that pushes the assembly, and all those around them, for whatever ideal they serve. They can rise to lead assemblies to greatness… or ruin.%0a%3c %0a%3c :Status 2 Host: Becoming a host shows that a voter has displayed some form of organization ability. Whether is providing safe haven for meetings, or making sure everyone attends meetings, the host is the grass-roots organizer that provides the backbone for the organization of the order.%0a%3c %0a%3c :Status 2-4 Letter Carrier: Like an Emissary the Letter Carrier is a type of emissary, though, there is a bit more to this position than the other. First, the letter carrier is known to travel abroad, second the letter carrier volunteers to have the memory altered with arcana so that they do not know what it is that they carry. A dedicated role, this is not used as much as it once was. Odd, to note, that a libertine would be willing to sacrifice a personal freedom to perform this task, but it does happen.%0a%3c %0a%3c :Status 2-4 Citizen Agent: These Libertines are more than Minutemen, they are the agents-provocateur, the spies and then covert operatives of the Assembly.  In an order with truth and openness as part of its bylines, the Citizen Agent is often hidden, unannounced in their role and their importance. They often answer to a select few of ranking Libertines in an area, sometimes only one.%0a%3c %0a%3c :Status 3-5 Strategos:Leaders of focus groups, this sums up the position quickly. Generals, politicians, statesmen and women. The strategos is a hard earned position that often times leads an assembly or represents the libertines in a Consilium. The problem is that outside of the area of expertise they are limited in their influence.

It is easy to lead when the path is clear, easy to see the future when the past is unobscured. For the Guardians of the Veil there is no easy, there is no way that they walk that is not riddled with sacrifice and loss. Lies, deceits, half-truths and shadows are the currency of the Guardians. The fight a war against their own, their enemies are often found inside the very Pentacle they protect. The Guardians protect magic, the Awakened, and they also protect the sleeping world from the Awakened world. When Mages prey upon the sleeping world the Guardians act, when mortal unearth an ancient tome, again they must act. More than the dream police or the supernal FBI, the Guardians believe, with a religious fervor, that their role is to make a better world. %0a%3c %0a%3c While they are not the awakened police, per say, they are similar to an IAD, an Internal Affairs Division. They stop Awakened from affecting the mortal world in supernal manners. Whether the vulgar magic, a particular dislike of Guardians because of their dogmatic beliefs, used by a new Free Councilors, or the abuse of sleepwalkers by a Silver Ladder Cryptopoly, the guardians look to uncover the wrongs committed by the Awakened so that they cannot be repeated. Are the Guardian’s their brothers’ keepers? Yes and no, they sacrifice for the Pentacle because while they believe the Awakened must herald in a new age, Guardians know they cannot lead. So they seek to defend, as best they can in manners that they can, so that those who do lead, lead  justly. Their perception, like any other order, can be skewed based on the leadership of the order. %0a%3c %0a%3c If this were not enough to cast a shadow of doubt and insecurity when dealing with the Guardians, then their almost cult-like fanaticism and structure is the proverbial nail in their supernal coffin. The order itself believes in prophecy and in the coming of a new age, an age that they, in their service and their suffering, herald into being. It is during this time that the sins of the Guardians will be judged, will ways equal means, or will all the suffering be for naught as the Guardians are once again considered the Pariah of the Awakened. There is no easy answer, there is no simple truth. The Guardians keep their secrets, hiding their motivations deep and dark, for every truth that is uncovered about the order a half dozen lies are used to swaddle the information until there is nothing left to believe.%0a%3c %0a%3c Guardians utilize many tactics that mirror the Seers of the Throne, extensively using mortals, sleepwalkers and sleepers alike. A labyrinth is as complex as a Silver Ladder Cryptopoly and twice and dangerous. Here the cults rise and fall, the sins of a few are dispersed to the many, and sometimes, there is a required payment for these sins. Sometimes, the only thing on the menu is the Kool-Aid and there is no choice but to drink.%0a%3c %0a%3c  [--%25color=#365776%25[[#top| Back to top]]--]%0a%3c %0a%3c [[#Guardians of the Veil-P]]%0a%3c !!!Playing a Guardian of the Veil%0a%3c The Guardians here are in a tight spot, everything they do is done in the full view of the Consilium, or, so they say. The Hierarch, a Guardian himself, was forced into the position, one that any Guardian would gladly avoid. But luckily, the Hierarch knows how to play the game, and has made it so that when the Guardians press a case, they win. It has taken some work, but this is not a city where the Guardians try to infiltrate the other orders, or the Seers, The lines are clearly drawn and posted on the Map… almost as if taunting some enemy to strike, to make a … mistake.%0a%3c %0a%3c To play a Guardian you are going to have to be able to follow the tenants, the thesis of the Guardians of the Veil while also balancing a very public persona. Your masques, should you choose to utilize them, should be the best face forward so that the Consilium thinks that the Guardians are cornered, and cowed. It will be hard to do, but only the brave can truly understand sacrifice and reward for that suffering.%0a%3c %0a%3c  [--%25color=#365776%25[[#top| Back to top]]--]%0a%3c %0a%3c [[#Guardians of the Veil-S]]%0a%3c !!!Guardians of the Veil Setting%0a%3c The chosen few, the survivors, the Guardians of the Veil still exist in Savannah.  The scars are faded, five years will do that, but the memories are still there hidden behind the eyes. ‘‘Siafu’’ still carries the Hierarch’s title, a title she never sought but now tends to as seriously as can be expected. She refuses to sit down when the Consilium is convened; so it is hard to say she holds that chair. Even now, with all that has been done, all thrones are false. Her voice echoes when she speaks, addressing the present and the past, part of her still lost in events that happened half a decade ago. She and her lieutenant, ‘’Moraceae’’,  are among the handful that survived the pogrom against the Guardians, the few that remember a week’s worth of terror and loss. Some have fled, no longer willing to live in Savannah, others have retreated, sealing themselves away so that their demons do not affect others.  Then there are those that died as they had lived, as Guardians of the Veil in the war against the Lie and the Abyss.%0a%3c %0a%3c ‘‘Siafu’’ never asked to be the Hierarch, no, that was a political machination orchestrated by -Heron. - She knows this, but she does not hold it against -Heron, - he does not realize that sacrifice is needed to protect the awakened, the sleepers, and those caught in between. Free Councilors rarely understand sacrifice without martyrdom; sometimes one just has to act without other’s watching.  ‘‘Siafu’’ understands that, understands sacrifice; this is what Guardians do. ‘‘Siafu’s’’ sacrifice is that she must lead the Consilium, for now, as best she can in a role that any Guardian would normally avoid. She understands the price she must pay for being a survivor, for protecting those who remain, and she pays it with quiet service.%0a%3c %0a%3c Savannah once held a large contingent of Guardians that operated, not so much with impunity, but with consistency. These were not the shadowy figures that existed in the rumors and myths of other Consili, these were active Awakened who worked in and outside of the Consilium. The Guardians were respected, in a way, by the other orders. They followed the Lex, they performed their duties, and for the most part, they worked outside of the city when they were needed. Their reputation followed them, of course, but they did their best not to live up to the accusations normally reserved for Guardians. %0a%3c %0a%3c Now Savannah has a smaller population of Guardians than before, and their public mask has been forced because of the other orders. The Guardians, with ‘‘Siafu’’ as their example, have become adepts at following the rules. Every ‘t” is crossed; every “I” is dotted. They follow the Lex, some becoming quite skilled at its interpretation and application. Before -Titus,- of the Silver Ladder, was accused of collusion with the enemies of the pentacle,  he had mandated that Apostates would be banned from Savannah, holding these unknown members of Awakened society accountable for much of what had happened. Oddly enough, ‘‘Siafu’’ rescinded this mandate, allow Apostates back into the city. Her comment on why she allowed the Apostates back into Savannah as a cryptic, “They have made their sacrifice.” %0a%3c %0a%3c The Guardians survive, tenacious and dedicated, they believe in ‘‘Siafu’’ and her leadership. They trust in ‘‘Moraceae’’ and his hand as ‘’Siafu’s’’ lieutenant. The Guardians are willing to sacrifice so that others will be free from the lie, they know that their cause, no matter what others think, is just, and that they will be judged for their actions. Their relationship with the other orders is odd at the best. With the ladder they have a bond built from shame and rebuilding. With the Arrows they receive a quiet admiration for those who survive and continue to fight. The Free Council is haughty, self-stylizing themselves as victors who now can act without their mythic threat of the Guardians hanging above them. The Free Council feels it has this freedom, and for some reason they now act more like a traditional Diamond order. And then there is the Mysterium. No one can judge the relationship between the Guardians and Mysterium, there is a chasm between the two, one of polite détente reminiscent of the Cold War.%0a%3c %0a%3c  [--%25color=#365776%25[[#top| Back to top]]--]%0a%3c %0a%3c [[#Guardians of the Veil-S]]%0a%3c !!!Guardian Order Status%0a%3c Make sure you have taken a look at the status primer as it will give you the overview for the entire venue. This portion will be broken down into two distinct parts. The status in the order and the status in the Consilium:%0a%3c %0a%3c To gain status in the order begins with what is covered in the status primer. Forward the goals of the Guardians of the Veil, do so in a manner that never implicates the order, never seems to cross the line. Learn the loopholes in the Lex, learn the ways to champion the cause of the order and then make it seem like it is done for the Consilium.%0a%3c Defending the order from attacks, take the war to the Seers without breaking the truce, and following the tenants of the order in the plain and open view of the Consilium without getting caught, these will increase your status and standing. Another way is to forward your understanding of the Guardians, and its ways. In the GOV supplement there are core ideals and these ideals are the basis of guardian thought. Best to get an understanding of them if you want to advance.:%0a%3c %0a%3c  [--%25color=#365776%25[[#top| Back to top]]--]%0a%3c %0a%3c [[#Guardians of the Veil-CS]]%0a%3c !!!Guardians and Consilium Status%0a%3c It is difficult for a Guardian to gain Status in the Consilium, there are just too many who distrust even the simplest actions of the Guardians. The trick, then, to call it that, is giving a Consilium no choice but to recognize the worth, and the value, of a Guardian as a member of the Consilium. By performing Consilium required tasks, to the very letter, Guardians can rise to some measure of status in a Consilium. The Consilium can detest a Guardian for their perceived work, but without proof, they egalitarian nature means the a Consilium must reward those who prove their worth.. For enterprising players, a character could learn from another order, in clear view of the Consilium, which would be very un-Guardian behavior.%0a%3c %0a%3c  [--%25color=#365776%25[[#top| Back to top]]--]%0a%3c %0a%3c [[#Guardians of the Veil-B]]%0a%3c !!!Beliefs of the Guardians of the Veil%0a%3c Necessary Secrets and Sins%0a%3c 	Paradox strengthens the Abyss as punishment for Pride.%0a%3c 	Sins for a Just End grant Wisdom to the Awakened%0a%3c Merit Must Guide the Fallen World%0a%3c The Esoteric Tenets:%0a%3c 	All Thrones are False all Souls are Flawed%0a%3c 	There is a Secret Hierarchy of Souls%0a%3c 	The Hieromagus will fulfill the Diamond Wheel%0a%3c Praxis: The Law of the Mask%0a%3c 	Learning to Remember%0a%3c 	Parables and Koans%0a%3c 	Oral Histories and Prophecies%0a%3c The Culture of Secrecy%0a%3c 	Anonymity and Reticence%0a%3c 	Habitual Surveillance%0a%3c 	Levels of Trust%0a%3c The Divine Thread%0a%3c 	Defend the Awakened%0a%3c 	Protect the Sanctity of Magic%0a%3c 	Weaken the Enemies of Atlantis%0a%3c 	Prepare the Way for the Hieromagus%0a%3c %0a%3c You will notice I did not add what each of these means. If you have the book you are willing to read the information there, but more importantly, you will define these concepts in your character’s terms. When looking to advance you will be required to understand and define what these ideals mean in game for you. It will take a little bit of writing, but you do not have to write a novella. Also, you will not have to write on each subject, when looking to advance you will be given a selection of these ideals and you need to format them in a way that is congruent to how you have been playing your character. Status will not just be handed out because you want to rise in rank, there is some work to do.%0a%3c %0a%3c  [--%25color=#365776%25[[#top| Back to top]]--]%0a%3c %0a%3c [[#Guardians of the Veil-Pos]]%0a%3c !!!Positions in the Guardians of the Veil%0a%3c :Status 1 Cultor: Of all the lower status members, cultors tend to have the most responsibilities. They are to develop, as their name suggests, cults that follow the doctrine of an Epopt. These members of the Guardians of the Veil are tasked with the creation of Labyrinths, secret societies and occult groups that follow whatever mandate is set forth by the Guardians of the Veil. They are active, leaders from the shadow even as their Silver Ladder counterparts lead from the pulpit. They lie, they exaggerate or depreciate the words of others. They are confidants, best friends and dangerous enemies. Successful creation of a labyrinth does not always end for the Awakening of its members, sometimes it ends with their deaths.%0a%3c %0a%3c :Status 1 Emissary: The order appointed herald of sorts; the emissary is meant to be a tool of communication between the Guardians of the Veil and other orders. Unlike its Consilium counterpart, the Emissary has been known to use blackmail, threats, and other nefarious means to communicate the wishes of the Guardians to other Awakened. Working both within, and outside of the order, it is the emissary that often relays messages from the Epopt to Cultors, though their status is the same, the message comes from on high and the words are best when followed.%0a%3c %0a%3c :Status 2 Interfector:It is at this level of status that the Guardians earn the ire of this rest of the awakened. Torturers, murderers and assassins the Interfector position is the blood hand of the Guardians of the Veil. Used carefully, and not always acknowledge by the Consilium which supports the Guardians, the Interfector plays the role of the evil that must be done. Occasionally, however, it is the Interfectors who must bear the brunt of the anger of the Consilium, the position is not for the weak of heart. They are not blind in their devotion, they must balance their need with the need of the Consilium and the Guardians of the Veil, but when they are called upon they must be able to act without flinching.%0a%3c %0a%3c :Status 3 Susceptor:The Specialists of the Guardians, the Susceptor position is one fraught with perils unlike the other positions. Where Interfectors may be used as scapegoats and occasional object lessons Susceptors do not have the shielding influence of the Guardians to protect them. They are often the spies, the deep agents focused on a specific goal. They often must work alone, but their work is important to the Guardian cause.%0a%3c %0a%3c :Status 4 Epopt: Unlike a totalitarian ruler that one might expect, the Epopt is a politician and a communicator. The role of the Cultor has a certain need for independence and it is the job of the Epopt to organize these various independent factions so that they work together. They must balance the ebb and the flow of politics within the Consilium so that while everyone may suspect the Guardians of misdoings, they have no proof. Of all the members of the Guardians, it is the Epopt who knows the majority of the secrets of the Guardians; therefore, they are the most protected.%0a%3c %0a%3c  [--%25color=#365776%25[[#top| Back to top]]--]%0a%3c %0a%3c [[#TM]]%0a%3c !!The Mysterium%0a%3c %25lfloat text-align=center margin-top=5px margin-right=15px margin-bottom=5px margin-left=0px%25http://wantonwicked.gamingsandbox.com/wiki/images/mta/symbols/mta_logo_m.png%0a%3c The days of pulp, of action and adventure in an idealized time, live large and strong in the minds of the sleepers and awakening does not change the draw to the fantastic. Stories about quests, of plumbing hidden depths, the search for ancient lore and more importantly, treasure, are a favorite escape. The silver screen has made Quartermain, O’Connell and Carnahan, Croft and Jones names that invoke images of fedora’s and dusty boots, whips and Wesley revolvers,  temples in jungles, and the ever present threat of traps, animals and the occasional Nazi. This is the glamorous ideal of the Mysterium, the dashing adventurer off to secure ancient relics of Atlantis before they fall into the hands of an enemy. The flip side is the spidery scribe dipping an archaic quill into a well of India ink before they laboriously transcribe a tome that will never make the New York Best Sellers list. Again, the image is vivid; the skeletal like hands, the drawn pale skin, and the knowledge hidden behind blank eyes that have seen and read too much. The Mysterium is both, and neither, it is an order dedicated to the supernal, to the secrets hidden within, and the understanding that knowledge is power, it should be hidden wisely.%0a%3c %0a%3c The Mysterium, like the Adamantine Arrow, the Guardians of the Veil and the Silver Ladder trace their roots to Atlantis, to a time before the sundering of the realms. Before the celestial ladder was shattered and the Awakened were driven from their flawed Utopia, the Mysterium questioned, they researched and experimented with the arcane, the sublime and the supernal. In this their role has not changed, they still seek the mysteries, the answers, and the additional questions that their research provokes. But, the Mysterium has evolved; they now protect the secrets of the Supernal as much as the Guardians of the Veil. They covet relics of the past; they seek to collect the fragments of a long forgotten time. And, unknown to most orders, what the Mysterium cannot collect they are often times willing to destroy.  For every curator in the Mysterium there is also a member who is willing to be a thief, a procurer of goods in legal and illegal manners. Some members wear the façade of the scholar while also being a sometimes assassin; the pen truly becomes mightier than the sword with these members. %0a%3c %0a%3c There are those in the Mysterium who are completely content to avoid politics, to ponder a question, or a series of thoughts, until they find an enlightenment that they can share with others. Others are as dangerous in the political arts as any of the other orders.  Some stay quiet, recluses and hermits, they shun contact with others because their magic is their art and they are dedicated in protecting their art. There are the researchers and supernal scientists practicing forgotten rituals and rites, there are the laymen and women who do what needs to be done to keep the Order organized and functioning. The Mysterium, like the other orders, is everything said about it, and nothing. Their secrets are well kept, well hidden. Their practices are steeped in tradition and history, they are the lore masters and keepers of history, always with an eye to finding hidden truths even as they hide other information for their own safe keeping.%0a%3c %0a%3c  [--%25color=#365776%25[[#top| Back to top]]--]%0a%3c %0a%3c [[#TM-P]]%0a%3c !!!Playing a Mysterium%0a%3c The Mysties are not always super-secret bookworms that speak in riddles and Walken-esque tangents. They are like any other order, diverse and driven with a combination of order and personal goals. They have an interest in knowledge that is shared, but its interpretation is a personal one. The Mysterium is organized, very organized as one might suspect. Positions carry weight, and the access to further mysteries is strictly governed. Those who perform are rewarded, but with each reward come more responsibility, and more questions. The Mysterium seeks… that is the best way to say it. They seek, but what they seek is just part of the secret of being a member of the Mysterium.%0a%3c %0a%3c It is safe to say that mental skills are highly valued by the Mysterium. But that is just a little too easy. The ability to communicate is balanced with the ability to research. Patience is more than a virtue with the Mysterium, it is a requirement. Many of the younger members take time in learning this skill, but it is one that will serve them well during their time as a Mystie.  Something the Mysterium player must remember is that not everyone will want to question, want to look for the hidden secret or the obscure fact. During these times it comes down to those Mysterium members who are strong enough to influence others to assert themselves. Mysterium member must have the potential to lead, especially in times where their skills are the best use to the party. They need to know when silence and reserve must be put on the shelf and action must occur. Those are the Mysterium characters that will catch the eyes of others, both inside and outside of their orders.%0a%3c %0a%3c  [--%25color=#365776%25[[#top| Back to top]]--]%0a%3c %0a%3c [[#TM-S]]%0a%3c !!!Mysterium Setting%0a%3c The Mysterium waits, patiently, watching all that happens and recording what needs to be remembered. Well, what they deem needs to be remembered might be a better way of saying it. The Order has been an institution in Savannah, it is not exactly sure if it was the Mysterium or the Adamantine Arrow that first sought out the area now known as Savannah. If ‘‘Hattan’’ was not a Mysterium then it was those member of the Mysterium  arriving to study his work, and staying to complete  their  own work, that has made this Order  the longest active member of the Diamond in Savannah. %0a%3c %0a%3c During the trouble five years ago, it was ‘’Aislin’’, Curator and Senior Daduchos, who accused, and provided evidence against, ‘‘Titus’’ of the Silver Ladder. The then Hierarch was accused of aiding those forces that had all but destroyed the Guardians of the Veil. It was also ‘‘Aislin’’ who offered the seat of the Hierarch to the Free Council’s ‘‘Heron’’ instead of to the then hierophant ‘’Mariannas’’. What some believed was soon to be a schism within the Mysterium ended up becoming a cliché when ‘‘Mariannas’’ announced his retirement before subsequently vanishing from Savannah. It was… of course, a Mystery, and no one in then order seemed to know why ‘’Mariannas’’ retired as he did. %0a%3c %0a%3c When ‘‘Heron’’ suggested ‘‘Siafu’’ for the position of Hierarch it was ‘‘Aislin’’ who supported the idea without a pause even as she assumed the now vacant hierophant’s position within the Mysterium. If there was dissention or grumbling, it was never voiced, the Mysterium did not seem to miss a beat as a; war ended, one Hierarch was sacked and another installed and the leadership of their Order changed hands in the space of hours. The Mysterium displayed its ability to play politics, ‘‘Aislin’’ appeared to be a kingmaker in the mold of the Silver Ladder, but she did not push whatever agenda she had by suggesting -Heron.- Since that time ‘‘Aislin’’ has quietly supported the Hierarch, but the warmth between the two seems strained at best. Perhaps this is why the  Mysterium has preferred to let its councilors act in the interest of the Consilium instead of moving as an Order. %0a%3c %0a%3c The strongest bond the Mysterium has currently is with the Free Council, though that is not saying much. The Free Council spent some time trying to prove their self-stylized manner of an Assembly nee Consilium was correct, only to find out the amount of work it took to balance out the different orders. The Mysterium has never actually said, “ We told you so,” but the looks and the occasional comment tell the true story. With the Silver Ladder, there is a cold peace, the ousting of ‘‘Titus’’ and the besmirching of the Silver Ladder’s pride, even for the “right” reasons has strained relations between the orders. The Mysterium and the Guardians of the Veil have never been close, those who keep secrets tend to have a hard time making friends with others who keep secrets. Finally, the relationship with the Arrow is, odd at best. ‘‘Kreig’’ and ‘‘Aislin’’ do not dislike one another, nor do they like one another, there is some wedge between the order, a wedge neither side is willing to speak on.%0a%3c %0a%3c For now the Mysterium works on various projects, most of which are hidden away from the prying eyes of other awakened. Some projects are even obfuscated from members within the order, their secret reserved for those who are needed for their abilities. This is, of course, the nature of the Mysterium, the nature of an order built around the concepts of information and knowledge. Projects aside, the Savannah Mysterium is rumored as having one of the greatest vaults of items, artifacts, and pieces of knowledge on the Eastern Seaboard. The Athenaeum supposedly boasts a treasure trove hidden away and moderated by curators and acquisitors, sometimes growing, being traded with others for different relics. The Mysterium members stay busy, and are often known to develop some impressive frequent flyer miles. And then there is also rumor that there has been a break through on -Hattan’s- project, a deciphering of purpose and meaning that will change the face of the awakened landscape. %0a%3c %0a%3c  [--%25color=#365776%25[[#top| Back to top]]--]%0a%3c %0a%3c [[#TM-OS]]%0a%3c !!!Mysterium Order Status%0a%3c Make sure you have taken a look at the status primer as it will give you the overview for the entire venue.

Seek the hidden and the unknown, solve the mysteries and puzzles presented to you. Forward the will of the order in the Consilium and deflect the attention of others when they seek to gauge the strength of the Mysterium.

Sleepwalkers can attain this rank and prepare themselves for the future.%0a%3c %0a%3c :Status 1 Senior Neokoros: Those who have not found specific roles within the Mysterium still have a value as the Senior Neokoros. They guide the initiates and the sleepwalkers, ready to advance themselves and the Mysterium they serve.%0a%3c %0a%3c :Status 1 Acquisitor:It's dangerous work, dirty work, but it is a popular position, These are your tomb raiders, your Indian Jones’s. These are the Mysterium members willing to travel, willing to throw their bodies and minds on the line in the search for artifact and relic, for tome and for knowledge. Some are thieves, others are called worse, but their role is clear, first dibs on whatever they find.%0a%3c %0a%3c :Status 1 Censor: Imagine the Guardians of the Veil branch of the Mysterium. When the Acuqisitor is off pursuing fame and treasure it is the censor who must do what dirty work remains. Censors do just as their name suggests, they censor the use of dangerous artifacts and knowledge, procuring it, hiding it, and sometimes even destroying it. Whether it is a device, a page of forgotten lore, or a person, the censor must have the iron will and the belief that what they do is for the better of all awakened.%0a%3c %0a%3c :Status 2 Daduchos: Meaning “torch Bearer” the Daduchos is the rank of the teaching branch of the Mysterium. These are the Awakened who guide the Neokoros and the daily function in a Mysterium’s Caucus.  This rank must be attained before being considered for a Savant role.%0a%3c %0a%3c :Status 2 Savant: The true record keepers, the savants live in two worlds, the occult and the mundane, coalescing theories and studies and recording them as best they can. They catalogue, the write, but most importantly, a savant is required to remember /everything/ they do. This is a hard position to attain, harder still to keep as some information should never be remembered.%0a%3c %0a%3c :Status 3 Senior Daduchos: Before becoming a Curator a Mage must first attain Senior Daduchos. These are the Mysterium who are challenging myths, searching for more esoteric and hidden lore.%0a%3c %0a%3c :Status 3 Curator: A patient and learned individual, the Curator is often the respected advisor as well and the personnel manager of the Mysterium. They organize Athenaeums, they promote the Mysterium values both in and out of the order. They are active in the Consilium but avoid the normal power plays and overt signs of action. They are politicians, and at times, even warriors in the social arena.  At times they marshal resources, organize and arrange the troops, other times they wait, patiently, until they are needed.%0a%3c %0a%3c :Status 4-5 Hierophant: The head of the order, the vision and the focus of the Mysterium caucus. Representing the order to the Consilium, the Hierophant has mastered certain secrets, finding out that there is no end to the mysteries to be solved.%0a%3c %0a%3c  [--%25color=#365776%25[[#top| Back to top]]--]%0a%3c %0a%3c [[#SL]]%0a%3c !!The Silver Ladder%0a%3c %25lfloat text-align=center margin-top=5px margin-right=15px margin-bottom=5px margin-left=0px%25http://wantonwicked.gamingsandbox.com/wiki/images/mta/symbols/mta_logo_sl.png%0a%3c The politician, the activist, and the manic street preacher telling you the end is nigh. It could be the bullhorn in a crowd causing the mob to surge and swell  or a preacher standing above a congregation, every word spreading faith and devotion. The Silver Ladder is often thought of as the blue blood aristocracy of the Pentacle, but the truth is far different than the fiction. Some of the members of the Ladder claim a heritage lost in the time since Atlantis, but no Ladder living today can draw a direct pedigree back to the founding families of the ancient city. The role of the Silver Ladder is that of a leader of people, their role is that of service for the Awakened and the sleeping world.  They are the spreaders of vision, of counsel and the scions of those ancients who believed in action. For ages the Silver Ladder has been the backbone of the organization of the pentacle, before the Free Council existed, it was the Ladder who proliferated a vision of the future, the need to evolve, to adapt, and to lead the sleeping world to an Awakened nation. Even now, the members of the Ladder regularly find themselves in the roles of counselors for the wise and the leaders of the Awakened. %0a%3c %0a%3c Some Ladders lead in Battle, as dangerous and cunning as their Adamantine Arrow Counterparts, others lead through education, as wise and knowing as members of the Mysterium. Many would like to think of the Silver Ladder as little more than popinjays puffed up with self-importance, and sadly some Ladders will fit this bill, but to be a Silver Ladder one must have a confidence that, to some, boarders on arrogance. Self-assurance that their cause is right, that their purpose is just, this is a hallmark of a Silver Ladder. Some might call it hubris, a hubris that goes back prior to the forging of the celestial ladder that would be the doom on Atlantis. These naysayers are the opponents of the Silver Ladder not because of their own investment, they are antagonists fed on the propaganda and muddled history of the other orders and the non-believers. The Ladder call hubris a cowards ward, a thin façade that the Awakened who cannot lead, who cannot “do,” hide behind. %0a%3c %0a%3c Seen by many as the pretender kings or as elitist, the Silver Ladder is thought as an anachronistic organization, especially to those of the Free Council. However, it has been the mission of the Silver Ladder to guide the Awakened in their goal to tap into the supernal mysteries. The Silver Ladder fights to remember the past, not to dwell in it, a part that is often overlooked by other orders. A silver Ladder is aware of his or her Order’s pedigree, but understands that it is the acts of the Silver Ladder today that guide the future. Some lead from the Hierarch’s seat, others as trusted advisor of wizened councilor. The role of a Ladder is not easy, constantly challenged by what some call progress the modern Silver Ladder must be part statesman, part warrior, and part sage. The Ladder is not for the weak of heart, mind or soul.%0a%3c %0a%3c  [--%25color=#365776%25[[#top| Back to top]]--]%0a%3c %0a%3c [[#SL-P]]%0a%3c !!!Playing a Silver Ladder%0a%3c The ladder sometimes is thought of as the “invictus” ( for you pointy toof players) of the Mage game. Some people do try to play the Ladder in this manner, but that is limiting in many ways. Mages do not respond to the power of ancient families when they have the same amount of power themselves. Blue blood spills as fast are red and white collars can be toppled by blue. The silver Ladder should be the role of a leader, or of a trusted advisor. These characters are more than boardroom executives who move pieces on a phantasmal chessboard. The Silver Ladder rewards leading from the front, helming the course of the Awakened nation in the form of a Consilium or a Cabal as well as providing leadership and counsel to the mortals who still slumber. %0a%3c The skills for a Ladder will be varied,  but expression and the ability to communicate are key. Whether a scholar, or a preacher denouncing the sins of the flesh and alcohol on a campus, the Ladder character must be able to communicate. This is not to say there are not warriors among the Ladder, the warrior caste, for a lack of a better term, is versed in combat that could include sword or a pen. Sometimes more is done with a word or a signature than even an army could accomplish, and the Silver Ladder player should remember this. Ladders are meant to be dynamic individuals, with great risk comes great reward.%0a%3c %0a%3c  [--%25color=#365776%25[[#top| Back to top]]--]%0a%3c %0a%3c [[#SL-S]]%0a%3c !!!Silver Ladder Setting%0a%3c A punch drunk prize fighter clinging to the ropes , the ten count echoing in their ears, taking minutes, years to process as they struggle to stand once again. This is the Silver Ladder of Savannah. Their reign had been long, their reign had been great, too great, and then they paid a price. The decimation of a pentacle member was laid at their feet. Their leader, the leader of the city, of the Consilium was charged with aiding and abetting. Suddenly the losses of another Order became their burden, their Lament as the once bright star of the Magisters was run out of town and the order was left leaderless. That was the hubris, the price of folly and arrogance that was paid by the Silver Ladder. Their faith in ‘‘Titus’’ made them weak, made his brilliance a Panacea for all that would ail the order. Once he was gone, the remaining members of the order were left to fend for themselves. %0a%3c %0a%3c It took some time, but the order finally looked into the mirror and remembered what it is. The Free Council, under ‘‘Heron’’ Was merciless for the first two years after the near destruction of the Guardians. Every mistake made by the Ladder was a reminder of ‘‘Titus’’ and his failure, the Ladder was hammered in the Consilium, its pride continually shattered as a price for their failure. The Free Council became the institution and ‘‘Heron’’ appeared to gloat during his greatest triumph.%0a%3c %0a%3c Then there was change. A new Ladder entered the city three years ago, ‘’Alsace’’, Lictor and Factotum of the Silver Ladder, she arrived like acanthi sometimes do, at exactly the right time. She engaged ‘‘Heron’’ openly, arguing the Lex, pointing out that she was not part of the Consilium during the troubles, and that the law was blind to the orders, it was written for all Awakened, all members of the pentacle. ‘‘Heron’’ found himself having to work against this Ladder and the lambasting of the Silver Ladder, and the constant reminder of the near destruction waned against this new bastion, one who could play politics with a silver tongue or a hidden knife.%0a%3c %0a%3c With ‘‘Alsace’’ drawing the attention of the Consilium, primarily the Free Council, to herself, Claviger ‘‘Decimus’’ began the reorganization of the Silver Ladder. It was true, they had relied on ‘‘Titus’’ too much, put all their supernal eggs in one basket. Their cryptopolies had been shattered and had dispersed in the two years since ‘‘Titus’’ left. Some saw this as a sign that ‘‘Titus’’ truly was deserving of the accusations against him, other saw it as the scattering of evidence of his innocence. Whatever it was the ladder regrouped, they rebuilt, and now their toes are dug into the ground and they are ready to push back into the Consilium, to retake their place. The Free Council’s dream of assembly didn’t work, the Consilium remains a Consilium, and it is a playing field that the Silver Ladder can finally level, perhaps erasing the stain left on their name.%0a%3c %0a%3c Right now the Ladder is coldest with the Free Council, but there should be no surprise. The Free Council has adopted the Hubris Mantle, treating their victory by continuously reminding the vanquished of their mistake. Their day will come, the scales will be balanced, and all debts will be paid. The relationship with the arrow is interesting. It is not warm, it is not cold., ‘‘Kreig’’ does not appear to share in the joy ‘‘Heron’’ has had in tormenting the Ladder, but he has not supported them either. Perhaps he is watching to see if they are willing to stand back up on their own two feet, if so, the attitude might change. With the Mysterium, the Ladder holds a silent grudge. It was ‘‘Aislin’’ who named ‘‘Titus’’ as a conspirator, but the evidence was never clear, there was no trial, for a moment the Lex was forgotten and passions swept through the Consilium, something has never set right because of that. And then, with the Guardians of the Veil… it is interesting, for orders that most often come to political blows the Guardians of the Veil has left the ladder be, ‘‘Siafu’’ does not say much in most cases, but says even less about the Ladder, yet the Guardians of the Veil have not stopped any progress made by the Ladder even when they had opportunity to do so.%0a%3c %0a%3c The Ladder is crawling up the ropes, bloodied but unbowed. Now is the time that they shake off the rust and the ringing in their ears as they step back into the fight. They will learn how string they are when the next punch lands.%0a%3c %0a%3c  [--%25color=#365776%25[[#top| Back to top]]--]%0a%3c %0a%3c [[#SL-OS]]%0a%3c !!!Silver Ladder Order Status%0a%3c Make sure you have taken a look at the status primer as it will give you the overview for the entire venue. This portion will be broken down into two distinct parts. The status in the order and the status in the Consilium:%0a%3c %0a%3c To gain status in the order begins with what is covered in the status primer. Forward the goals of the Silver Ladder whether in the Consilium or the mundane world. Lead from the front, by example, and forward understanding of the Silver Ladder precepts, order goals and mandates. Find and develop ways to encourage mortals to awaken, lead or guide mundane institutions to better themselves and push for their Supernal birthright. At times Silver Ladders will be judged on how they are perceived by others, for better and for worse. Sometimes antagonism is good when it causes positive action. %0a%3c %0a%3c Following the establishment of the Consilium, following the Lex Magica and making others see the wisdom of the Lex is also considered when thinking of status. The Ladder cannot be passive in their actions and expect others to notice. Sometimes a velvet glove must cover and iron fist. The Silver ladder follows what are called the Elemental precepts. They are broken down like so:%0a%3c %0a%3c  [--%25color=#365776%25[[#top| Back to top]]--]%0a%3c %0a%3c [[#SL-CS]]%0a%3c !!!Silver Ladders and Consilium Status%0a%3c A member of the Silver Ladder gains status in the Consilium by performing Consilium required tasks, many of which will parallel tasks assigned by the order. One of the most important investments of the Silver Ladder is the Lex Magica, so strengthening and defending the Lex is a consistent example of how the Silver Ladder can serve in the Consilium. Acting as Councilors, heads of Cabals, and supporting the Organization of the Consilium along more traditional lines is a way to gain status. Also serving in various positions or functions are ways for enterprising characters to gain status in the Consilium.%0a%3c %0a%3c  [--%25color=#365776%25[[#top| Back to top]]--]%0a%3c %0a%3c [[#SL-Pr]]%0a%3c !!!Precepts of the Silver Ladder%0a%3c The Diamond Precept:%0a%3c 	The Awakened are One Nation%0a%3c 	Enemies of Unity - those who are enemies of the Awakened Nation%0a%3c 	Hieraconis - The Nation yet to come%0a%3c The precept of Thunder:%0a%3c 	Imperium is the Right of Man%0a%3c 	The Stag, The Lion, The Sage - The roles of the Silver Ladder%0a%3c 	Inspiring Power%0a%3c The Precept of the Star%0a%3c 	The Silver Ladder is the Path To Victory%0a%3c 	Spirituality%0a%3c 	Law and Justice%0a%3c 	Government%0a%3c The Precept of Blood%0a%3c 	The Sleepers Follow%0a%3c 	Religion%0a%3c 	Politics%0a%3c 	Secret Societies%0a%3c %0a%3c %0a%3c  [--%25color=#365776%25[[#top| Back to top]]--]%0a%3c %0a%3c [[#SL-Pos]]%0a%3c !!!Positions in the Silver Ladder%0a%3c :Status 0-1 Acolyte: The initiated and the new. These members of the Silver Ladder have begun their elemental pilgrimage and they stand ready to take the steps that will lead them to a greater understanding of themselves. To attain status 1 an Acolyte should have decided which precept they are going to follow and then they will begin to develop their relationships inside and outside of the Ladder.%0a%3c %0a%3c :Status 2 Lictor, Factotum, Acolyte (Superior):The acolyte is still an acolyte with status two, though they have developed a reputation or some form of clout. They Silver Ladder ought to be beginning their cryptopoly by now, or focusing on other aspects of the Silver Ladder. These other aspects could be the Factotum position, a position covered in more depth (here.) The Factotum is a student and a specialist in the Lex Magica, they are often the ones who add amendments to a Consilium’s Lex and are sought after as advisors. The Lictor, which is a rare position is a travelling ladder who prosecutes the Lex in times of dire need. They have special exemptions regarding the Lex. Few Lictors are not also qualified Factotums. To gain the status of Lictor will take serious work in game, and one will need to have the Silver Ladder supplement to fully understand the character requirements.%0a%3c %0a%3c :Status 3 Claviger: The Claviger is a role that requires a character to put Order business and mandate before all else. They are expected to understand all of the elemental precepts and how they affect the Consilium and the mortal world. They are teachers, mentors and the guides to newly awakened Ladders. Often times Clavigers are the emissaries to the Consilium and other awakened when it is not expedient to use Heralds. These ambassador duties could include dealing with ghosts, spirits, and in the event of dealing with other supernatural creatures, it is the Claviger’s duties to forward the goals of the Silver Ladder.%0a%3c %0a%3c :Status 4 Deacon: The position of Deacon is actually a sacrifice, it is the suppressing of personal desire to plumb the Supernal mysteries to serve the Silver Ladder. Deacons define the role of an order in a city, and represent their city in larger congregations.  The Deacon is often a master in some way, but not always, sometimes it is a person of rare vision and dedication who can attain this role.%0a%3c %0a%3c Part of gaining status in the Silver Ladder is the formation of Cryptopolies. There will be a longer post on what these are, and what they might entail will take up its own post.%0a%3c %0a%3c  [--%25color=#365776%25[[#top| Back to top]]--]%0a%3c (:include CityBook.MageNavigationBar:)%0a
