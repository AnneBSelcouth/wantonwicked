He constructed a fortified house on the southeastern tip of the island overlooking the Skidaway Narrows, a strategic section of the Skidaway River located along the intracoastal waterway roughly halfway between downtown Savannah and the Atlantic Ocean. The fortified house was part of a network of defensive structures established by James Oglethorpe, founder of Georgia, and early Georgia colonists to protect Savannah from a potential Spanish invasion. Jones subsequently developed Wormsloe into a small plantation, and his descendants built a large mansion at the site which they used as a country residence.The State of Georgia acquired the bulk of the Wormsloe Plantation in 1973 and opened it to the public as a state historic site in 1979.%0a%0a!!!The Mansion%0a%0a%25rfloat text-align=center margin-top=5px margin-right=0px margin-bottom=5px margin-left=15px%25http://wantonwicked.gamingsandbox.com/wiki/images/mta/locations/wormsloeplantation2.jpg%0aThe Mansion is certainly spacious enough for Savannah’s Consilium, luckily the Consilium does not meet that often. When it does, the staff is reduced, and those who remain are sleepwalkers often tied with the various orders. The bar is often self-serve, and the kitchen is closed after providing finger foods and hors d’oeuvres, cleanup is simple as each member of the Consilium is expected to police themselves, Southern manners and all. The Consilium is careful about its presence in the Mansion; the building is old, a history hidden in the woods. The footsteps that have trod the halls are heavy, and they occasional feeling that ghosts, or spirits, watch the events at hand is not uncommon.%0a%0a!!!The Cemetery%0a%0a%25rfloat text-align=center margin-top=5px margin-right=0px margin-bottom=5px margin-left=15px%25http://wantonwicked.gamingsandbox.com/wiki/images/mta/locations/wormsloeplantation3.jpg%0aMore often used as a site for marriages and escapes, the Wormsloe Mansion is a relic of a South that predates the Civil War. Hidden away south of Savannah, the Wormsloe house is by the Consilium for an Occasional gathering, one that can host the various and numerous Awakened of the city. Not too far from the main house, nee mansion, is a private cemetery once used by the Jones family. This would not be of note, as many properties had private cemeteries back in the early colonial period, but the boundaries of the cemetery act as a Demense. It has been standing law that the area is left undisturbed in regards to the nature of the Demense, but it has been, at times, been used with the permission of the Hierarch, to practice, research, and experiment with arcana.%0a%0a!!!The Dueling House%0a%0a%25rfloat text-align=center margin-top=5px margin-right=0px margin-bottom=5px margin-left=15px%25http://wantonwicked.gamingsandbox.com/wiki/images/mta/locations/wormsloeplantation4.jpg%0aFormal duels, accepted by multiple parties and with the permission of the Sentinels or the Consilium, have used this building on the former plantation’s main grounds for decades. The Dueling House, as it is known among the Awakened, was once a church on the Wormsloe Plantation. Even before its acquisition by the State of Georgia, this building had been the site of duels dating back to the early 20th century. The Consilium of Savannah, with the Plantation tenant’s unknowing permission and then with the state’s, has been using the former church for decades. First as a meeting place, and then as formal location for duels, the small building has seen the rise of the Savannah Consilium from the day its first stone was laid in a foundation.
