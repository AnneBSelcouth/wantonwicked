It is because of Lord Frostbite's leadership that the Alpha pack has managed to collect the other lesser packs under its banner, organizing them into a loose political organization that owes fealty to them at the top. The pack's members include:%0a%0a'''Eddie Reynolds (Lord Frostbite) -''' The Lord and Alpha of the Hegemony dresses simply, preferring loose-fitting t-shirts, jeans, and solid boots for hiking. He usually can be seen carrying a large battered guitar case strapped to his back. His demeanor is that of a true predator, in tune with his Harmony and possessing the respect and admiration of his peers. He is quick to remind others of the Oath and if angered will call down terrible storms that are impressive to behold as even the Heavens bow to his might. He is a powerful member of the Iminir with a mastery over powers of Weather.%0a%0a'''Buck One-Eye -''' This Elder is one of the least reputable, but nobody would ever dare to say it to his face. Buck's crawled into a bottle ever since conflict with the Azlu left his only son a hollowed out shell. He bares the blessings of the lunar choirs as a berserker, walking close to the path of Kuruth. He sometimes travels to the local pubs and bars, getting involved in brawls and thrown in jail where he's allowed to sleep it off. He is respected as a warrior knowledgable in several fighting-styles, but most notibly an expert in utilizing the Gauru to its fullest. This drunkard might be the best example of the Iminir tribe's refusal to stay down.%0a%0a'''Micha Forerunner -''' The second-in-command to the Alpha pack, she usually takes a back seat to the savage politics that rule the Hegemony. Her focus is upon maintaining the delicate promises and bargains that have secured the pack's rule over their territory, negotiating the surrender of ideal territory to younger packs in payment for their subservience. If approached, Micha prefers to wear simple dresses that offer ease of movement. Her long black hair is usually left to hang free down her shoulders. The powers of the half-moon allow her to mediate disputes between the different packs.%0a%0a'''Mike Tanner -''' There's always been a feeling of rivalry between Mike and Lord Frostbite, but despite their feuding bloodlines they work well together. Mike dresses in a long blackcoat, wide brimmed hat, and can usually be seen chewing a piece of bone or grass inbetween his lips. He walks with a slight limp, something that bothers him only lightly in his work as a new moon. He is the most learned of the pack, usually found reading passages from the bible or classic works. He can often be found quoting famous authors. He is closest with the pack's Ithaeur, Aaron. They can usually be found hanging out together.%0a%0a'''Aaron Dahl -''' This woman has given up much of what it means to be human. Her clothing is often torn or ripped from travel, and her features are plain and uninteresting. This witch moon usually can be seen walking bare foot, carrying with her various tokens or trophies from different spirits that she has dealt with. The strangest of the pack, her hair has grown long and disheveled. Aaron is a cousin to Mike Tanner, and when she begins speaking in strange tongues her fond child-hood memories with him are the only thing that seems to bring her back. Her madness aside, Aaron Dahl is an accomplished ritualist with many pacts and bargains with different spirits.%0a%0a%0a%0a[[%3c%3c]]%0a%25%25http://wantonwicked.gamingsandbox.com/wiki/images/wtf/headers/wtf_h.png%0a%0aThe Alpha pack were one of the few survivors of the Brethren War.

It has been theorized that the spirit is actually a Helion that was banished from its choir. %0a%0aThe pack, with the blessings of their totem, fought with everything they had to push back the encroaching lines of the Pure Tribes. They also came to each of the packs in turn, collecting those weaker than themselves and promising patronage and protection if they served. They either negotiated or forced other packs to join their organization, creating something that has not been seen in Savannah before...%0a%0aThey created a political organization of werewolves, forged from many packs embracing the rule of one pack over all. This Hegemony has stood strong for two decades against the Pure Tribes, committed to the goal of retaking the surrounding territories and resurrecting the rule of the Tribes of the Moon.%0a%0a[[%3c%3c]]%0a%25%25http://wantonwicked.gamingsandbox.com/wiki/images/wtf/headers/wtf_rph.png%0a''Savage Politics-'' The politics of the Hegemony are as savage as its members. There are tense negotiations between each rival pack, and PCs may be asked to help in bringing more unruly members of the Hegemony in line.%0a%0a''The One True King-'' Lord Frostbite is powerful but he is getting older. There are dissenters in the ranks, and the Lord and Alpha may ask for PCs to investigate rumors or spy on the packs that have sworn fealty to the Alpha pack.%0a%0a''Bloody Politick-'' The Hegemony maintains ties to various spirit broods and perhaps other stranger entities. The players may be asked to work as messengers or ambassadors to any of these other groups. Maybe they need to escort an ambassador to the Pure Tribes to setup a cease fire?%0a%0a[[%3c%3c]]%0a%25%25http://wantonwicked.gamingsandbox.com/wiki/images/wtf/headers/wtf_q.png%0a"I will not abide the weak or the stupid.
