Standing at 5'4", she's of fairly average height, but Luminoct is incredibly skinny. Moreover, she's the kind of skinny that can eat anything and everything while not gaining an ounce. Her hair is a fiery red, often sprouting off in uncontrollable wisps and loose curls. Her eyes have a decidedly purple hue which is further exaggerated when she wears dark colors.%0a%0a%25color=#9c9c9c%25 Luminoct tends to dress in a more artsy hipster style. Large glasses often sit on the bridge of her nose, and the girl seems rather fond of skirts, sweaters, leg warmers, and boots. Her color palette never seems to have much black in it. When it does, it's usually built around some splash of accentuated color. Her face rarely has much makeup on it, aside from blush, cat-eyeliner, and bright red lipstick. When unfurled, her Nimbus appears as shards of prismatic light flashing and refracting around her like broken glass in the air.%0a%0a[[%3c%3c]]%0a(:cellnr colspan=3 width=380 bgcolor=#000 align=right:)%0a%25%25http://nokturnis.net/graphics/wanton/storyhooks.jpg%0a(:cellnr colspan=3 width=380 bgcolor=#000 align=left:)%0a%25lfloat text-align=center margin-top=5px margin-right=15px margin-bottom=5px margin-left=0px%25http://nokturnis.net/graphics/wanton/spacer3.jpg%0a%25rfloat text-align=center margin-top=5px margin-right=0px margin-bottom=5px margin-left=15px%25http://nokturnis.net/graphics/wanton/spacer3.jpg%0a%25color=#9c9c9c%25 '''Stranger (Consilium):''' %25color=#9c9c9c%25 ''Luminoct joined the Awakened of Savannah at the tail-end of 2013.

Standing at 5'4", she's of fairly average height, but Luminoct is incredibly skinny. Moreover, she's the kind of skinny that can eat anything and everything while not gaining an ounce. Her hair is a fiery red, often sprouting off in uncontrollable wisps and loose curls. Her eyes have a decidedly purple hue which is further exaggerated when she wears dark colors.%0a%3c %0a%3c %25color=#9c9c9c%25 Luminoct tends to dress in a more artsy hipster style. Large glasses often sit on the bridge of her nose, and the girl seems rather fond of skirts, sweaters, leg warmers, and boots. Her color palette never seems to have much black in it. When it does, it's usually built around some splash of accentuated color. Her face rarely has much makeup on it, aside from blush, cat-eyeliner, and bright red lipstick. %0a%3c %0a%3c [[%3c%3c]]%0a%3c (:cellnr colspan=3 width=380 bgcolor=#000 align=right:)%0a%3c %25%25http://nokturnis.net/graphics/wanton/storyhooks.jpg%0a%3c (:cellnr colspan=3 width=380 bgcolor=#000 align=left:)%0a%3c %25lfloat text-align=center margin-top=5px margin-right=15px margin-bottom=5px margin-left=0px%25http://nokturnis.net/graphics/wanton/spacer3.jpg%0a%3c %25rfloat text-align=center margin-top=5px margin-right=0px margin-bottom=5px margin-left=15px%25http://nokturnis.net/graphics/wanton/spacer3.jpg%0a%3c %25color=#9c9c9c%25 '''Stranger (Consilium):''' %25color=#9c9c9c%25 ''Luminoct joined the Awakened of Savannah at the tail-end of 2013.
