She was born in August of 1985, to Thomas and Marleen MacReady, a loving husband and wife of honestly modest means living in Sandusky, Ohio. Marleen was a waitress at a local diner, while Thomas was a manager of a chain department store. It was a good life for Gwen, she had plenty of friends, did well in school and was generally well-adjusted. Well, sometimes things change...%0a%0aIt was a little past her 13th birthday when her parents decided to go along with that new fad, something that would be referred to as the "Dot-com Boom". And they struck it big, racking up several million with some decidedly modest investment, along with a bit of stock market insanity. They got out quick too, probably could've made even more if they had waited. Still, it was enough for the pair, and they decided they were going to live the high life, something neither ever had the chance to do. They packed up whatever they wanted to bring, then flew across the country, ending up in the San Francisco area in an extravagant new house.%0a%0aUnfortunately for Gwen, she didn't share her enthusiasm. All her friends and hangouts were back in Ohio. Not to mention the new school she wound up in, a private institution housing some of the most wealthy kids in the Bay area. And oh did she hate them. Not only were they snobs who loved to flaunt their money, money that they had no hand in earning, but they were "old money", born into families who had never known anything but wealth. But her, she was "new money" and they never let her forget. She did her best though, keeping her head down, keeping to herself. No, she didn't make friends here, and she didn't care to. Nor did her parents, no, they were too busy enjoying all that newly found wealth, trips to Paris, London, The Bahamas, Tokyo, where ever their hearts desired. And Gwen was left alone, working on her homework in that big, quiet house.%0a%0aBut that time wasn't wasted, and after graduation, she found herself accepted into Claremont McKenna College, gradually making her way into The Robert Day School of Economics and Finance, finally graduating with Bachelors in Economics. She had made herself proud, mostly because she was the only person who seemed to notice. She had continued avoiding seemingly everyone within school, shunning them to focus and finish her degree. Her graduation even slipped past her parents, too buy skiing in the Alps to show up to the graduation ceremony.%0a%0aGwen headed out to find herself a job in the furthest place she could, both from her parents' home, and their life. And she certainly found the perfect spot as she ended up managing a club in downtown Detroit, Michigan. It was trashy, it was low-class, and it was everything she could've hoped for, using all that expensive education to wind up right back socially where she was as a kid, if not a bit lower. And sure, she had a few hundred thousand dollars in a savings account, but still, that didn't change her into one of those rich snobs.%0a%0aIt took a few months, but she finally let her guard down, ending up socializing a bit with the club owner, Louis Dimas. Louie was a little like her, he didn't really seem to belong at that club, even if he was the owner. No, the pair were certainly above where they had put themselves, but neither seemed to mind. It was around a year before Gwen learned the real reason Louie was in such a place though. She got to learn the terminology, that the club was a local rack, that Louie was a Mekhet, and that vampires weren't something that just existed in movies. She wound up being Louie's ghoul and personal assistant, first at the club, then getting brought into his further employment. It turned out Louie owned a couple gun stores in the city, completely legitimate places. Of course, every legitimate place has a backroom. Well, the club had a bathroom at least, leaving a secluded place to deal drugs, and every deal gave a cut to the club. The stores had backrooms for guns that weren't quite legal to sell in the stores.%0a%0aGwen spent another year as Louie's personal assistant before he finally decided to bring her into the fold, making her a fellow Mekhet. What a life it was, slumming it in the club, running guns all across the state, this was the life for young Gwen MacReady, and she got to live that life nearly four more years.%0a%0aSee, Louie ended up making a killing on a pretty simple deal to some out-of-towners. Turns out the reason that price was so high was that The Prince had put out a decree to not make deals with that group, and Louie knew full well how much he could price gouge them. But word quickly got out in the club that The Prince was looking to make an example of Louie, something both he and Gwen heard. Where as Louie brushed it off, Gwen decided this would be an excellent time to find a new home, a new city. A few days after she left Detroit, she heard about a fire consuming the club, all the way to the pavement. The police found Louie, or at least, what they guessed was him, a nicely charred corpse. Gwen, meanwhile...well, she had heard Georgia was nice this time of year...%0a[[%3c%3c]]%0a%0a%25%25http://wantonwicked.gamingsandbox.com/wiki/images/vtr/headers/vtr_rph.png%0a'''Guns, Guns, Guns!''' -- With a fair amount of contacts of the criminal persuasion, Gwen mostly makes her unliving acquiring and selling guns that might not be considered entirely legal. While she doesn't make a habit of it, she's entirely able to gather other illegal objects if given enough time. Perhaps you're looking for more firepower, and think the newly arrived vampire might have the best contacts? Or hey, she's from Detroit, maybe she can get you some illicit substances?%0a%0a'''I -am- the Manager''' -- Gwen has some excellent, entirely legal skills as well, mostly related to business management. Even if you're not searching for someone to fill a permanent position, she certainly would be available to offer advice, and being unaligned leaves her services open wide for the time being.%0a%0a'''The New Girl''' -- While not entirely unaccustomed to moving, this is the first time Gwen has moved cities after her embrace. While her sire offered her tips on visiting other cities, she's sort of having to wing it since arriving at Savanna, trying to introduce herself to the right people. If she manages that or not, well it's really up to luck.%0a[[%3c%3c]]%0a%0a%25%25http://wantonwicked.gamingsandbox.com/wiki/images/vtr/headers/vtr_con.png%0a''A modest amount of criminal contacts, but Gwen has yet to acquire any real contacts within Savanna.''%0a[[%3c%3c]]%0a%0a%25%25http://wantonwicked.gamingsandbox.com/wiki/images/vtr/headers/vtr_q.png%0a''"Not familiar with guns?
