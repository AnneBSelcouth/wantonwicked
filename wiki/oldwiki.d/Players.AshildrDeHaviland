Like encountering a living statue of idealised proportions, she leaves a deep dread in the pit of your belly that's hard to shake. She pulls away from her physical androgyny with a very feminine style of dress and her milk-white hair worn long.  She has delicately rose-tinted lips when they are unpainted, even in her lifeless state. Her eyes are a clear, bright violet, as jewel-like as palest amethyst in flattering light. Her skin carries an exotic perfume of oud, anise, nightshade and ambergris. %0a%0a->%25color=#B8B8B8%25She wears a gold signet ring on her left hand, etched with the sigil of House Haviland. The rest of her jewellery consists of silver bracelets on her wrists and ankles that chime softly as she moves and invariably also a delicate, silver, celtic torc around her throat; Its open ends wrought in the aspect of Garmr, the Norse hell hound, with amethysts for eyes. In addition to these other adornments is a silver chain hung with several alligator teeth. This last item, more often than not, is concealed by her clothing. %0a%0a->%25color=#B8B8B8%25Written in fresh black ink each night, where her wrist meets her thumb, are the words 'Adio Iman'.%0a%0a-> %25float text-align=center margin-top=5px margin-right=0px margin-bottom=5px margin-left=170px width=300%25http://i490.photobucket.com/albums/rr261/milokoplus/jewellery_zps048f7c94.png%0a%0a[[%3c%3c]]%0a%0a%25lfloat text-align=center margin-top=15px margin-right=15px margin-bottom=15px margin-left=15px width=350 newwin%25http://i490.photobucket.com/albums/rr261/milokoplus/Cloak2_zpsf8846526.jpg%0ahttp://i490.photobucket.com/albums/rr261/milokoplus/publichistory_zpsd530ab85.png%0a%0a->%25color=#B8B8B8%25The Bastard Childe of the De Haviland Dynasty. Not her favourite title, but one she knows is well used behind her back by the Estate. Adopted into the Ventrue house some eighteen years ago, she only began making public appearances around a decade later. Well mannered and obviously the product of expensive Invictus Au Pairs, she began running the De Haviland business alongside Lord Victor de Haviland, the Dynastic head at the time.%0a%0a->%25color=#B8B8B8%25As his personal assistant she earned status for herself in the First Estate, becoming a trusted Steward to the Lords and Ladies of Savannah, who are known to entrust a great many of their finer possessions into the care of the De Havilands, for a price. Lord Victor de Haviland has recently succumbed to torpor. The new Dynastic head has relocated the seat of the family to another city, leaving Ashildr in control of their Georgia based assets and business while Victor slumbers. So far, so good. But that is quite a responsibility for one vampire to carry on their shoulders.%0a%0a->%25color=#B8B8B8%25For the past eight years Ashildr has served as Steward for a number of prestigious families and individuals in the Invictus, earning herself a great deal of trust and a good reputation for efficiency and all manner of associated expertise. Recently, she took on the role of Au Pair to a Gangrel by the name of '''[[Tracy Delaney]]'''. Now, Mister Delaney walks amongst the Kindred of Savannah with the de Haviland seal on his signet ring and a certain polished and tailored appearance to clothe that feral swagger of his. %0a%0a->%25color=#B8B8B8%25A number of other Kindred have joined her at House Haviland, taking up roles in her life that aren't clear to the rest of vampire society. '''[[Frankie Burstrom]]''', a Dragon Mekhet that seems to spend a great deal of time in Ashildr's shadow. '''[[Goat]]''', an Acolyte Gangrel, Savannah's most magnificent bastard and the biggest storm to hit the city since the Revenant Prince stirred up the show. Then there's '''[[Gideon Ward]]''', not quite a resident but a frequent visitor to Ashildr's mansion on Wilmington Island. A well respected member of the Carthian Movement, Gideon is perhaps the most unlikely associate for the Haunt to date. %0a%0a[[%3c%3c]]%0a%0a%25rfloat text-align=center margin-top=15px margin-right=15px margin-bottom=15px margin-left=15px width=350 newwin%25http://i490.photobucket.com/albums/rr261/milokoplus/Cloak3_zps939973ab.jpg%0ahttp://i490.photobucket.com/albums/rr261/milokoplus/roleplayhooks_zpsf8718e47.png%0a%0a-> %25color=#B8B8B8%25 '''Exquisite Things''' - (Anyone) If you have a taste for the fine things in life, the exotic or the extremely rare, from strange antiquities and vintage wines to unusual pets, Ashildr will likely be able to secure what you desire. She runs an outwardly legitimate business with no physical premises, operating as a consultancy. Find De Haviland Brokers online when searching for delectable oddities or else hear about them via high society connections. %0a%0a-> %25color=#B8B8B8%25 '''Speed Freak''' - (Anyone) A few hours before dawn, any night of the week, Ashildr may be found pushing her car to its limits on the dark and lonely roads of the outer domains. %0a%0a-> %25color=#B8B8B8%25 '''Etiquette''' - (Vampires) As one of the lower ranking titled members of the Invictus, she tends to be one of the more approachable faces of the First Estate. A good starting point for those looking to join its ranks or just make a connection that's on the marginally less intimidating end of the Estate's rigid hierarchy. As a member of the De Haviland Dynasty, she has been schooled by the Estate's finest and most expensive Au Pairs before her 'debutante' year. She is known to be willing to offer the groundwork of that schooling, with no promises made that you'll graduate, to those that don't have the backing for more formal tuition. %0a%0a-> %25color=#B8B8B8%25 '''Ventrue Culture''' - (Vampires) As a member of the Ventrue dynastic House Haviland, she has particular sympathies with those of the Ventrue Clan. Abiding by expected hospitalities and other ritualised traditions. She wears the sigils of Clan Ventrue and House Haviland in many of her adornments, but most particularly in the etched gold signet ring on her left hand. A side effect of her adherence to the culture of a clan other than her own is that she has become somewhat maligned by her own clan.%0a[[%3c%3c]]%0ahttp://i490.photobucket.com/albums/rr261/milokoplus/connections_zpsea8c3e24.png%0a[[%3c%3c]]%0a%25lfloat width=60px height=60px %25http://www.heroesandhellions.com/wp-content/uploads/2012/10/Michael-Rooker-202x269.jpg%0a'%25color=#999999%25[[Tracy Delaney]] - '''Protege', Bodyguard and Coterie Mate''' ''Tracy Delaney strode into Savannah  and sought out Ashildr de Haviland directly. There's got to be a story in that. She took him in and gave him a place in her territory, her home and her Covenant. Fostering the man into the Invictus the slow but sure way, via the methods of an Au Pair. Her efforts have paid off. The man can more than hold his own in their society. Now he's clad in his own take on custom tailoring and wearing the sigil of House Haviland on his ring.

The first people heard of an association between Ashildr and Goat was when it hit the rumour-mill that she had publicly fought the man. He was supposedly the victor. A strange, cold association began between them as he joined her growing coterie. Down the line she came to be protective of Goat, going out of her way to put out the many fires he started amongst the Kindred. Recently there has been some sign that their relationship is turning to an unlikely romance.''  %0a[[%3c%3c]][[%3c%3c]]%0a%25lfloat width=60px height=60px%25http://img593.imageshack.us/img593/9981/q4d4.jpg%0a'%25color=#999999%25[[Frankie Burstrom]] - '''Coterie Mate''' ''Ashildr's shadow. Frankie was the first to be taken in by her at House Haviland. Just when that happened is questionable, since his tenancy at House Haviland was declared long before Ashildr officially declared an association with him and his residence in her house. He is a loyal ally, more often than not literally shadowing her, taking a place at her back to interject with extensions to her sentences and a supporting role.''  %0a[[%3c%3c]][[%3c%3c]]%0a%25lfloat width=60px height=60px %25http://imageshack.com/scaled/800x600/405/e82f.jpg%0a'%25color=#999999%25[[Gideon Ward]] - '''Unknown''' ''As the would-be Harpies are saying all the time these days, Gideon Ward does spend an awful lot of time at House Haviland. His association with Ashildr isn't clear. One thing the de Haviland Lords are famed for is their passion for the Hunt.

This last item, more often than not, is concealed by her clothing. %0a%3c %0a%3c ->%25color=#B8B8B8%25Written in fresh black ink each night, where her wrist meets her thumb, is the word 'Adio Iman'.%0a%3c %0a%3c -> %25float text-align=center margin-top=5px margin-right=0px margin-bottom=5px margin-left=170px width=300%25http://i490.photobucket.com/albums/rr261/milokoplus/jewellery_zps048f7c94.png%0a%3c %0a---%0a> %0a> %25rfloat text-align=center margin-top=15px margin-right=15px margin-bottom=15px margin-left=15px width=400 newwin%25http://i490.photobucket.com/albums/rr261/milokoplus/Cloak3_zps939973ab.jpg%0a> http://i490.photobucket.com/albums/rr261/milokoplus/hooks_zps3a1a8b19.png%0a> %0a> -> %25color=#B8B8B8%25 '''Exquisite Things''' - (Anyone) If you have a taste for the fine things in life, the exotic or the extremely rare, from strange antiquities and vintage wines to unusual pets, Ashildr will likely be able to secure what you desire.

Not her favourite title, but one she knows is well used behind her back by the Estate. Adopted into the Ventrue house some eighteen years ago, she only began making public appearances around a decade later. Well mannered and obviously the product of expensive Invictus Au Pairs, she began running the De Haviland business alongside Lord Victor de Haviland, the Dynastic head at the time.%0a%3c %0a%3c ->%25color=#B8B8B8%25As his personal assistant she earned status for herself in the First Estate, becoming a trusted Steward to the Lords and Ladies of Savannah, who are known to entrust a great many of their finer possessions into the care of the De Havilands, for a price. Lord Victor de Haviland has recently succumbed to torpor. The new Dynastic head has relocated the seat of the family to another city, leaving Ashildr in control of their Georgia based assets and business while Victor slumbers. So far, so good. But that is quite a responsibility for one vampire to carry on their shoulders.%0a%3c %0a%3c ->%25color=#B8B8B8%25For the past eight years Ashildr has served as Steward for a number of prestigious families and individuals in the Invictus, earning herself a great deal of trust and a good reputation for efficiency and all manner of associated expertise. Recently, she took on the role of Au Pair to a Gangrel by the name of '''[[Tracy Delaney]]'''. Now, Mister Delaney walks amongst the Kindred of Savannah with the de Haviland seal on his signet ring and a certain polished and tailored appearance to clothe that feral swagger of his. %0a%3c %0a%3c ->%25color=#B8B8B8%25A number of other Kindred have joined her at House Haviland, taking up roles in her life that aren't clear to the rest of vampire society. '''[[Frankie Burstrom]]''', a Dragon Mekhet that seems to spend a great deal of time in Ashildr's shadow. '''[[Goat]]''', an Acolyte Gangrel, Savannah's most magnificent bastard and the biggest storm to hit the city since the Revenant Prince stirred up the show. Then there's '''[[Gideon Ward]]''', not quite a resident but a frequent visitor to Ashildr's mansion on Wilmington Island. A well respected member of the Carthian Movement, Gideon is perhaps the most unlikely associate for the Haunt to date. %0a%3c %0a%3c [[%3c%3c]]%0a%3c %0a%3c %25rfloat text-align=center margin-top=15px margin-right=15px margin-bottom=15px margin-left=15px width=350 newwin%25http://i490.photobucket.com/albums/rr261/milokoplus/Cloak3_zps939973ab.jpg%0a%3c http://i490.photobucket.com/albums/rr261/milokoplus/roleplayhooks_zpsf8718e47.png%0a%3c %0a%3c -> %25color=#B8B8B8%25 '''Exquisite Things''' - (Anyone) If you have a taste for the fine things in life, the exotic or the extremely rare, from strange antiquities and vintage wines to unusual pets, Ashildr will likely be able to secure what you desire.
