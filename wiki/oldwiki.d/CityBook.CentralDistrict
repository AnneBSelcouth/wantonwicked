Ardsley Park is considered one of the most affluent neighborhoods in Savannah. Primarily a white neighborhood, at current it is one of the city's "hottest neighborhoods" and is favored by both young professionals and families alike. With median to high rents with the median home value of $222,275, though large estates can cost more than $1 million. Neighborhood attractions include the Hotel Georgia, a breathtaking hotel with a troubled past. Bounded by Hopkins, West Victory, Bull, West 59th and West 52nd.%0a%0a!!!Dixie Avenue%0a%0aDixie Avenue (Upper Class), Central District%0a%0aThere is a place where the Central District meets with Downtown and East Side, a place where the wealthy and powerful go to indulge their darkest whims, their most freakish urges, where they taste the o-so-very-forbidden fruits. It is the boulevard of sin, the path to temptation untold, the neighborhood from which boardroom executives and spoiled brats slink home with carnal desires fulfilled and shames untold: it is, of course, Dixie Avenue.%0a%0aDixie Avenue features a host of exclusive enterprises, each one more corrupt and debased than the last. Glamorous escorts move gracefully through the throng at the night club - weaving effortlessly between youngsters snorting lines of cocaine and important bankers gluttonously quenching their thirsts with champagne - just to sell you, yes -you-, a night in heaven for four-digits sums. Armani suits, Rolexes, and Prada purses are commonplace, the standard rather than an exception, and important men share secrets and jokes in hushed whispers.%0a%0aClubs catering to the most perverse proclivities accept new members by invitation only, ensuring that the clientele belongs to the most esteemed circuits of Savannah. And for those with money, there are no limits, no bans, no one that will say "no." Then, when dawn breaks, each and every one wonders, "is anyone going to find out?" And still, they come back again, and again, and again.%0a%0a!!Chatham Crescent%0aChatham Crescent takes its name from the county of Chatham and the beautiful Beaux Arts master-plan that incorporates the crescent and several circular parks as the centerpiece of the neighborhood.%0a%0aHomes are similar in varying architectural style to Ardsley Park with a distinct difference in regards to the lot configuration on the street side and many of the lots are irregular because of the sweeping curves. Whereas Ardsley Park has a front yard, sidewalk, tree lawn curb configuration, Chatham Crescent has the trees planted in the front yard then the sidewalk and curb.%0a%0aThe downside of the neighborhood, is the fact that half of it is littered with gang signs, dealers, and crime that has been creeping from the west in recent years.  The western half of Chatham Crescent, while on the outside it has a facade of being beautiful, the Blue Magic Crips claims almost half of the neighborhood.  Residents who wish the Police would do more to protect their youth from being inducted, but it's hard to say anything when fear is starting to grip their hearts.  To make things worse, an other gang claims area just outside of their streets, so walking at night is highly discouraged, just no one talks about it.%0a %0a!!District Features:%0a>>lrindent frame border='1px solid #898989' bgcolor=#eeeeee padding=15px%3c%3c%0a'''City/Mortal''':%0a*'''Underworld'''%0a**Crips Territory %0a**Bloods Territory%0a>>%3c%3c%0a%0a>>lrindent frame border='1px solid #005826' bgcolor=#eeeeee padding=15px%3c%3c%0a'''Changeling''':%0a>>%3c%3c%0a%0a>>lrindent frame border='1px solid #003471' bgcolor=#eeeeee padding=15px%3c%3c%0a'''Mage''':%0a>>%3c%3c%0a%0a>>lrindent frame border='1px solid #9e0b0f' bgcolor=#eeeeee padding=15px%3c%3c%0a'''Vampire''':%0a* Domain of [[Players/Edward Corey]], Carthian Movement%0a* Location Rating: 4%0a>>%3c%3c%0a%0a>>lrindent frame border='1px solid #74483f' bgcolor=#eeeeee padding=15px%3c%3c%0a'''Werewolf''': [[Players/Sherman's March]] turf%0a>>%3c%3c%0a%0a!!District Locations:%0a(:sortable align=center:)%0a||class=sortable id=CDLocations%0a||!Location||!Venue||!Owner||%0a||[[CityBook.MemorialHealthUniversity|Memorial Health University Center]]||[[CityBook.CityBook|Any]]||None||%0a||[[CityBook.New Path Community Center|New Path Community Center]]||[[Players.Vampire|Vampire]]||[[Players.MichaelBertramYoung|Michael Betram-Young]]||%0a||[[Citybook.TheDineronAbercorn|The Diner on Abercorn]]||[[Players.Mage|Mage]]||Stephen and Margie Anderson(NPC)||%0a||[[CityBook.CrossFitHyperformance|Crossfit Hyperformance]]||[[CityBook.CityBook|Any]]||None||%0a(:tableend:)%0a%0a%0a----%0a(:include CityBook.Directory:)
