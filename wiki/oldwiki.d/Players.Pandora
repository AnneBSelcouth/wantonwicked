The sharp vastness of her hazel gaze and the fullness of her lips combine with a slim yet prurient silhouette to give her an intrinsically indecent quality. This lowborn image is only bolstered by her sinuous postures and long sable hair, both seeming to coil and curl just enough to subtly imply depravity.''%0a%0a:Style:%0a''Clothing varies greatly, switching from street to urban or utilitarian images with ease. Her natural impurity makes anything seem vulgar, but she has a natural tendency to juxtapose the seen and the unseen in some subtle fashion. This may be as simple in expression as ripped jeans with her favorite leather jacket half-zipped, or as distinct as a dramatically slit dress.''%0a%0a:Demeanor:%0a''Pandora is decently friendly and glib despite the sinful appearances and shady company. Her expressions are naturally mischievous and sly, often with the taunting insinuation that she's not telling everything. The varied experiences that brought her here have given her an appreciation for most cultures and styles, so she's personable just about anywhere even if she doesn't quite fit in. In formal situations, she becomes much more ritualized and polite, as if silently holding to a rigid set of manners.''%0a%0a:Nimbus:%0a''(Mild) The sudden ring of a drawn blade flashes through the mind, and its lingering harmonic tone accompanies an enhancement of light and darkness in her presence borne from a shaded beam of light above. Like a subtle spotlight, every part of her revealed glows softly, and both her clothing and surroundings are momentarily shrouded over.''%0a%0a''(Severe) The ring of a drawn blade shears through the mind with a momentary sense of perfect lucidity, and the shadowed light beaming down places her in dramatic chiaroscuro. The metallic reverberation following the moment pierces the mind, seeming almost hypnotically pleasing in its chaotic yet ordered resonance. What is visible of her flesh seems all that can be seen, bathed in utter light, while all else in her immediate presence fades into a moment of glimmering darkness.''%0a%0a[[%3c%3c]]%0ahttp://wantonwicked.gamingsandbox.com/wiki/images/mta/headers/mta_h.png%0a%0a:Public:%0a''As a skilled exotic dancer at one one of the seedier gentleman's clubs for the last few months, not many people know her. Anyone that does remember her would rarely admit knowing as much about someone in her line of work, though their blush may be accompanied by a wistful smile. She's also present at bars with a preference for cheap vodka, and parks for a bit of exercise.''%0a%0a:Consilium:%0a''Pandora is a newcomer to the Consilium as of a few months ago, but hasn't made any waves yet beyond offering her skills in combat to the Pentacle's goals. She's present at most Consilium functions with some very interesting choices in fashion, often wearing eclectic styles of cloth and a sizable blade of some sort. Whether found in a skirt suit with her daisho or a slit dress with a kukri, there's a ritualistic politesse to her formal dealings that would shock those who knew her from outside these events.''%0a%0a:Order (Adamantine Arrows):%0a''A skilled combatant prepared for many situations. Pandora has a noted preference for edged weapons, though she's plenty capable in all forms of combat with a moment's notice. Ideologically, she seems hold to the Order's ideal of a traditional warrior-sage in a very quiet manner; Pandora isn't averse to discussion her place and plan in the Arrows, she just doesn't volunteer them without inquiry.''%0a%0a[[%3c%3c]]%0ahttp://wantonwicked.gamingsandbox.com/wiki/images/mta/headers/mta_rph.png%0a%0a:&#9834;&#9835;&#9834; She's A Maniac &#9834;&#9835;&#9834;:%0a''Exotic dancing puts her into contact with people of all sorts, not that many admit it, and she's talented enough to be noticed in very different circles with very different opinions of her line of work. Depending on what's known about her occupation and how others view it, the social context of her dealings might greatly change. Having seen her at her work might be even more jarring.''%0a%0a:Heart of Gold:%0a''There's a special place in her heart for the downtrodden and underprivileged, and a special place on the edge of her blades for those who would do them genuine harm. She won't give handouts, but she's liable to offer a sympathetic ear and a wise word to those who seem receptive, and likely to lend a helping hand for those in need. Petty concerns, on the other hand, enrage her.''%0a%0a:Queen of Blades: %0a''Pandora is a connoisseur of edged weapons, and it's not uncommon for her eyes to linger on any weaponry near her with a measure of interest and delight. All sorts of conversations might spark up from their presence depending on model, form, and circumstance. She's always looking for more blades to purchase or learn, too, and may make an offer for one if the time is right.''%0a%0a:Sellsword:%0a''Though her weapons are not for sale, certain services with them might be. She's always willing to act as a bodyguard, and for the right cost she's just as willing teach the art of war. For the right cause, she may even be willing to eliminate a target. This one is theoretically open to everyone, though it would require some setup for those who don't know her skills to make this kind of request. Mages are free to know, of course, as that information is open through the Consilium.''%0a%0a[[%3c%3c]]%0ahttp://wantonwicked.gamingsandbox.com/wiki/images/mta/headers/mta_q.png%0a%0a''"Quote."'' - [[Quoter]]%0a[[%3c%3c]]%0a%0a(:include CityBook.MageNavigationBar:)
