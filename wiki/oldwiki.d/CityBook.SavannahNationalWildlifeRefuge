They talk about a lot of things. Mostly they talk about how they want to slide their roots through your flesh to fertilize the ground."'' - Turn-Key, Ithaeur of the Lords of Mourning Glory.%0a%0aIn the territories of Savannah there is likely no place more important or revered to local werewolves than the Forest Heart, located in the center of the Savannah National Wildlife Refuge. This collection of forest and marshland is a powerful focus of spiritual energy, a place where leylines from across the land connect and cause the creation of loci. The Heart of the Forest is a powerful locus, offering rich stores of essence filled with a resonance of nature and decay.%0a%0aThe laws of the wild are reflected in startling brutality on the other side of the barrier where spirits predate on one another, creating a treacherous domain full of entities that keep secrets buried deep underneath the water. This ideal territory also serves another purpose...%0a%0aIt is a prison.%0a%0aIt was during the end of the Brethren War that the Lords of Mourning Glory collected lesser packs to their beneath their rule, and with a few talented ritualists, were able to throw back the Pure Tribes and their strange totems. The most dangerous of these totems were bound and imprisoned when able, locked inside of dangerously treacherous fetishes that were then buried inside of living trees using Nature Gifts. These trees were then spiritually awakened and bound themselves to act as custodians for their prisoners, keeping these alien entities from the deep spirit wilds locked away.%0a%0a!!The Tur%0a%0aThe meeting ground of the Forsaken in Savannah is a copse of trees, grown in a circle, on a patch of raised ground. This piece of pristine wilderness is where the packs come together to interact and create ever shifting allegiances. There is a central bonfire that is lit at night to provide illumination, and werewolf Gifts have hollowed out the ground beneath the meeting spot, creating a council chamber where the packs' leaders and representatives can meet privately to discuss policy and future actions.%0a%0aThis meeting chamber is a vast underground room, fortified by the living roots of the trees above. There exists in the central chamber a table, crafted from a still living tree, and a seat for every representative of each pack that claims membership in the Hegemony.%0a%0aIt is rumored that sometimes spirits or stranger entities come calling on the werewolves for their own reasons, offering promises and favors in exchange for support in their own causes.%0a* .
