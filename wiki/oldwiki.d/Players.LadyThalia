Many beings will simply stand in awe upon laying gaze upon her for the first time, finding it difficult to even gather the simplest of thoughts.  The most skilled seducer will stutter, the chastest priest will blush and the most loyal wife will imagine sinful scenarios. This is because not only is Lady Thalia strikingly beautiful, she is in fact a being of changing appearances, in several different ways.%0a%0aFirst of all anyone who lays eyes upon Thalia will see a different image than the other person who just gazed upon her. Lady Thalia appears as attractive as she possible could to every different individual and it is all in the details. Perhaps one on-looker prefers a slender, soft, thin-limbed lady while another one prefers an athletic, strong woman with sharp facial features. Her hair can be short or long, brown or ivory, fancy or simple just as her eyes can be intense or soft, green or blue or any other color and type imaginable. The only thing that remains true is that no matter what appearance she might take, she will be so awe-strikingly beautiful that you simply cannot help but to crane your neck and stare wherever she may go.''%0a%0aHer second changing appearance is that of the sun and the moon. Her title is, as newly introduced people will sooner rather than later find out, not only there to boost her ego. As the moon settles the highest during the middle of the night her beauty transforms. It doesn’t disfigure her but rather it twists her. Just as the most beautiful tree can have its branches deformed in the shadow of the night and the kindest dog can look menacing in the dark, Lady Thalia becomes a terror on everyone’s imagination as soon as the moon stands as high as it can. She does not turn hideous though, her beauty remains but those who look upon her no longer imagine her simply as the most beautiful thing they’ve seen. They also imagine her as one of the most terror-inspiring things they’ve seen. Her long nails turn into claws, sinister markings and tattoos grow over her skin and her devious smile reveals sharp teeth, strong enough to grind bone into flour. %0a%0a%0a'''Personality'''%0a%0aThe lady is as two-faced as her appearance is. During day being her servant is, by fae standards, not that bad at all. She is a noble-lady and expects to be treated as such, naturally, but she rules with grace and wisdom and seems despised by any acts of cruelty. Her smile is ever-present and she always seems to have time to pause with any of her servants. Yes, some have even spoken of straight out kind acts even in public, as a comforting word or a soft pat on the back. Indeed, at first glance it would seem that living with Lady Thalia would be a thing of wonder, excitement and warm memories.%0aThat is until nightfall. Not only does her appearance change but also her mannerism, especially towards her servants. Acts of straight out cruelty aren’t uncommon as soon as the moon has passed midnight and everyone in the household does their best to scurry out of Lady Thalia’s way. Other than her own two-folded nature she often sees a certain cruel beauty in opposites, and it has happened more than once, especially on the first night for newly arrived changelings, that the world has more or less literally been turned upside down. No matter what reason to they were brought by Lady Thalia, she would change and twist them, turning them away from their original path in life and turning them into something else. Her punishments and demands take monstrous proportions but to whatever little comfort it may be to her servants none of them last longer than until the morning sun. As the first rays of sun touch her holdings the Lady changes back and tasks and punishments end. The tasks demanded are no longer required and Thalia acts as if nothing happened, as if she had slept from dusk to dawn. %0a%0a%0a[[%3c%3c]]%0a%0ahttp://wantonwicked.gamingsandbox.com/wiki/images/ctl/headers/ctl_h.png%0a%25rframe%25 http://fc01.deviantart.net/fs70/i/2012/105/4/f/queen_of_the_night_by_anna_marine-d3k8n9g.jpg%0aLady Thalia’s domains would remind most historian onlookers of a Victorian-style grand mansion, fitting for a noble lady of great wealth and influence. Her garden is magnificent with long rows of beautiful trees, every single leaf cut into the perfect size by her servants and the same goes for the ponds, bushes and every single little flower. However, if her crown of her domain is the beautiful garden then her grand mansion is indeed the very heart. So large that the halls seem endless, filled with art, statues and rooms of all different sorts it is easy for changelings to get lost there, even for those who have lived and worked there for an extended amount of time. In order to control such a large domain Lady Thalia has handed authority to some of her changelings and they are encouraged to run things smoothly and kindly at daytime whenever she is present and harshly, like a sadistic dictator should she ever come across them during nighttime. She is also more than willing to exchange the people of authority at a whim, which of course has made the changelings dislike each other as much as they fear Lady Thalia. Those brave enough can smear other changeling’s names in her presence at nighttime and one can be sure that the poor soul will suffer only the harshest of punishment and degradation. Furthermore there are those who deny her dual nature all together, claiming that it is just a horrible nightmare within the fea realm, for could ever such a benevolent, beautiful and kind creature as Lady Thalia really ever harm anyone?%0a%0a'''Poor Michael Green'''%0a%0aThere are those, especially amongst the newly arrivals who have not yet been warned by their fellow changelings of the dangers of speaking of what happened during the night. One the most common stories in her mansion is that of Michael Green, whispered amongst the changelings and told to newcomers to help them avoid the same fate as Michael.%0aMichael Green was a clever student at a university, all brains and no brawn, often sick and weak. No problems in this modern world though, where physical prowess doesn’t determine your chance to have a high salary, get a nice house and live a good life. He was brought by Lady Thalia for his wits and intelligence in order to help with book-keeping, and although intimidated and scared he had served dutiful for the first day of his stay. During the first night however Lady Thalia found him in the library and got enraged when he could not recite the contents of one of her scrolls. He was subsequently forced into a torture-chair to have his skull squeezed and crushed until his mind was only a fraction of what it used to be. He was then ordered them to perform physical tasks instead, moving boulders and chopping firewood for the mansion. When Lady Thalia found him the next morning, weeping from the horrible experience and cutting wood, she couldn’t help but to feel sorry for him, and granted him strength to perform his tasks better. This is when Michael made a horrible mistake and complained about what had happened. Lady Thalia’s demeanor changed her voice surprisingly firm compared to earlier as she spoke.%0a“Last night was beautiful I agree, but why you must complain I do not see, go back to your task right now, or you will make me furrow my brow.”%0aMichael, young and foolish, complained yet again and insisted on that he had been hurt and wanted to know why. Maybe it was because his mind was damaged by last night’s treatment that he didn’t realize just how thin ice he was on. Lady Thalia simply left him standing there without a reply and avoided any contact with him for the rest of the day. As night came though Michael was suddenly lost never to be seen again, though if you wander close to the library at nighttime you may hear a young man crying in terror and pain.%0aThe story serves as a great reminder to any inhabitants of the mansion to never speak of the nights when Lady Thalia is present and even more importantly, to fear the night. %0a%0a[[%3c%3c]]%0a%0ahttp://wantonwicked.gamingsandbox.com/wiki/images/ctl/headers/ctl_rph.png%0a'''New Arcadia Shopping:'''%0aLady Thalia visits the markets every now and then in New Arcadia, if not in person then at least through servants, to gather any interesting items that might be avaliable.

Many beings will simply stand in awe upon laying gaze upon her for the first time, finding it difficult to even gather the simplest of thoughts.  The most skilled seducer will stutter, the chastest priest will blush and the most loyal wife will imagine sinful scenarios. This is because not only is Lady Thalia strikingly beautiful, she is in fact a being of changing appearances, in several different ways. ''%0a%3c %0a%3c First of all anyone who lays eyes upon Thalia will see a different image than the other person who just gazed upon her. Lady Thalia appears as attractive as she possible could to every different individual and it is all in the details. Perhaps one on-looker prefers a slender, soft, thin-limbed lady while another one prefers an athletic, strong woman with sharp facial features. Her hair can be short or long, brown or ivory, fancy or simple just as her eyes can be intense or soft, green or blue or any other color and type imaginable. The only thing that remains true is that no matter what appearance she might take, she will be so awe-strikingly beautiful that you simply cannot help but to crane your neck and stare wherever she may go.''%0a%3c %0a%3c Her second changing appearance is that of the sun and the moon. Her title is, as newly introduced people will sooner rather than later find out, not only there to boost her ego. As the moon settles the highest during the middle of the night her beauty transforms. It doesn’t disfigure her but rather it twists her. Just as the most beautiful tree can have its branches deformed in the shadow of the night and the kindest dog can look menacing in the dark, Lady Thalia becomes a terror on everyone’s imagination as soon as the moon stands as high as it can. She does not turn hideous though, her beauty remains but those who look upon her no longer imagine her simply as the most beautiful thing they’ve seen. They also imagine her as one of the most terror-inspiring things they’ve seen. Her long nails turn into claws, sinister markings and tattoos grow over her skin and her devious smile reveals sharp teeth, strong enough to grind bone into flour. ''%0a%3c [[%3c%3c]]%0a%3c http://wantonwicked.gamingsandbox.com/wiki/images/ctl/headers/ctl_h.png%0a%3c ''The lady is as two-faced as her appearance is. During day being her servant is, by fae standards, not that bad at all. She is a noble-lady and expects to be treated as such, naturally, but she rules with grace and wisdom and seems despised by any acts of cruelty. Her smile is ever-present and she always seems to have time to pause with any of her servants. Yes, some have even spoken of straight out kind acts even in public, as a comforting word or a soft pat on the back. Indeed, at first glance it would seem that living with Lady Thalia would be a thing of wonder, excitement and warm memories. ''%0a%3c %0a%3c That is until nightfall. Not only does her appearance change but also her mannerism, especially towards her servants. Acts of straight out cruelty aren’t uncommon as soon as the moon has passed midnight and everyone in the household does their best to scurry out of Lady Thalia’s way. Other than her own two-folded nature she often sees a certain cruel beauty in opposites, and it has happened more than once, especially on the first night for newly arrived changelings, that the world has more or less literally been turned upside down. No matter what reason to they were brought by Lady Thalia, she would change and twist them, turning them away from their original path in life and turning them into something else. ''%0a%3c %0a%3c Her punishments and demands take monstrous proportions but to whatever little comfort it may be to her servants none of them last longer than until the morning sun. As the first rays of sun touch her holdings the Lady changes back and tasks and punishments end. The tasks demanded are no longer required and Thalia acts as if nothing happened, as if she had slept from dusk to dawn.
