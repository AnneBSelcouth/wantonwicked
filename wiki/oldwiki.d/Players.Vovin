Not straight As, but still above most of her class—a 3.8 GPA is nothing to scoff at, especially when she had a bad habit of ditching on a regular basis. Everything was grand. Normal. College was a little trickier, as only a few had accredited library programs. Her obsession with books led her in that direction--one thing her parents encouraged even if they didn’t understand it. Curiosity mixed with a thirst for knowledge. So it was the University of South Carolina that became home for many years. It was one of the few that kept her relatively close to home, and that offered a Library and Information Sciences degree accredited by the ALA for both the undergrad and the graduate programs.%0a%0aAfter finishing the degrees, she now calls Savannah, and the Savannah Library, home.%0a%0a[[%3c%3c]]%0a%0a%0a%25rfloat text-align=center margin-top=5px margin-right=15px margin-bottom=25px margin-left=5px width=315%25http://i771.photobucket.com/albums/xx357/QuestionIntent/Personalities/Vovin/Vovin3_zpse3f6d64a.jpg %0a%0a%25left%25http://i840.photobucket.com/albums/zz329/isisrevised/hooks_zpsfcd33d05.png%0aHistorical topics, particularly ancient history, is an excellent topic, as are archaeology and myths. %0a%0aDo you like books?
