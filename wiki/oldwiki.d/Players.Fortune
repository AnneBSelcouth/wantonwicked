Sadly, that didn't last to long, as she was cited to be unsuited for the ''Visus Draconis'', and after a period of apostasy where she descended to live on the streets and suffered some sort of mental breakdown, she was eventually found and trained by a Silver Ladder of the Geechee community by the river lowlands. In time, she was initiated into the Order, and recently returned to the Consilium proper, studying under [[Players.Alsace|Alsace]] and preparing for her factotum exams.%0a> %0a51,55c52,60%0a%3c %0a%3c %0a%3c %0a%3c %0a%3c %0a---%0a> %25width=25%25http://wantonwicked.gamingsandbox.com/wiki/images/mta/symbols/mta_logo_gov.png '''%25newwin%25[[https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KQ6zr6kCPj8| %25color=#004a80%25Bro, Do You Even Veil?]]''' (Guardians): %25color=#33CCCC%25Back when ''Bethel'' was ''Robin'', she hung with the cool kids in town.

Her bust is generous, her skin is fair, and head is held tall with pride.%25%25%0a%3c %0a%3c %25color=#004a80%25The slight curl of her locks ends about halfway down her back, most days. She styles it as fits the situation of course; braids and buns, barrettes and elastic bands - but she has a preference for letting it run free, to frame her face; high cheekbones and plus lips. A straight nose and wide, steel-grey eyes able to bring up a bright intensity to their gaze.%25%25%0a%3c %0a%3c %25color=#004a80%25While she likewise dresses for the occassion; from formal robes to little black dresses. From rags to riches and back again. Even in her daily life, her wardrobe is eclectic; spanning from summer dresses to yoga pants, whirling past blouses and slacks and into jeans and t-shirts. The generalities that can be made is that she seems to have a hankering for vibrant colours, and she puts some pride in fair trade and quality-wear.%25%25%0a%3c [[%3c%3c]]%0a%3c %0a%3c %25lfloat text-align=center margin-top=5px margin-right=15px margin-bottom=5px margin-left=0px width=375 newwin%25https://dl.dropboxusercontent.com/u/43400366/Bethel/Bethel015.jpg%0a%3c :%25color=#33CC99%25Nimbus%25%25:%0a%3c %25color=#33CCCC%25'' The thudding of heartbeats, syncopating and harmonising, as though everyone nearby are synchronising into harmony.

Sadly, that didn't last to long, as she was cited to be unsuited for the ''Visus Draconis'', and after a period of apostasy where she descended to live on the streets and suffered some sort of mental breakdown, she was eventually found and trained by a Silver Ladder of the Geechee community by the river lowlands. In time, she was initiated into the Order, and recently returned to the Consilium proper, studying under [[Players.Alsace|Alsace]] and preparing for her factotum exams.%0a%3c %0a%3c http://wantonwicked.gamingsandbox.com/wiki/images/mta/headers/mta_rph.png%0a%3c %0a%3c %25width=25%25http://wantonwicked.gamingsandbox.com/wiki/images/mta/symbols/mta_logo_gov.png '''%25newwin%25[[https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KQ6zr6kCPj8| %25color=#004a80%25Bro, Do You Even Veil?]]''' (Guardians): %25color=#33CCCC%25Back when ''Bethel'' was ''Robin'', she hung with the cool kids in town.
