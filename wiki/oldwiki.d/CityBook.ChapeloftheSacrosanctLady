The building, originally known as ''Chapel of St. Martin's Hope'', was constructed by Lord Sebastian Waldrup, a local patron of the Church at the time. Lord Waldrup served as an officer in World War I and fell in battle during the Somme Offensive. His body was later returned to the United States to be buried beneath the chapel he had sponsored.%0a%0a%25color=#b95fa7%25 In the early 1960s, the chapel and surrounding property were auctioned off, having fallen into a neglected state of disrepair. Restoration work began but came to a halt after less than a few months as the chapel was sold once more. Over the next few decades, a handful of different owners bought and then sold it again, until finally Reverend Patrick Kerr restored it to its former glory. Kerr lead a small congregation for almost fifteen years, until he on the 15th of April 2005 violently and brutally murdered a local woman inside the chapel. Subsequent investigations and trials gave the location a rather tarnished reputation, a reputation that persists even to these days.%0a%0a%25color=#b95fa7%25 The chapel changed owners again in 2009 and was unceremoniously renamed to ''the Chapel of the Sacrosanct Lady''; Jesabella Woodridge is the unofficial benefactor of the chapel while Pastor William Green serves as the pastor of the assembly. Apart from holding sermons, the pair have been known to host community events, raise money to feed and clothe the poorest in society, and in other ways contribute to a safe, prospering, and pious neighbourhood.%0a[[%3c%3c]]%0a[[%3c%3c]]%0a[[%3c%3c]]%0a%25height=40%25http://s24.postimg.org/oag560itd/people.png%0a%25lfloat text-align=center margin-top=5px margin-right=15px margin-bottom=5px margin-left=0px newwin%25 http://s18.postimg.org/tbl3pvyeh/insidethechapel.jpg%0a%25color=#b95fa7%25 Pastor William Green: The pastor is a middle-aged man with a receding hairline and warm, green eyes.

The building, originally known as ''Chapel of St. Martin's Hope'', was constructed by Lord Sebastian Waldrup, a local patron of the Church at the time. Lord Waldrup served as an officer in World War I and fell in battle during the Somme Offensive. His body was later returned to the United States to be buried beneath the chapel he had sponsored.%0a%3c %0a%3c %25color=#b95fa7%25 In the early 1960s, the chapel and surrounding property was auctioned off, having fallen into a neglected state of disrepair. Restoration work began but came to a halt after less than a few months as the chapel was sold once more. Over the next few decades, a handful of different owners bought and then sold it again, until finally Reverend Patrick Kerr restored it to its former glory. Kerr lead a small congregation for almost fifteen years, until he on the 15th of April 2005 violentenly and brutally murdered a young, local woman inside the chapel. Subsequent investigations and trials gave the location a rather tarnished reputation, a reputation that persists even to these days.%0a%3c %0a%3c %25color=#b95fa7%25 The chapel changed owners again in 2009 and was unceremoniously renamed to ''the Chapel of the Sacrosanct Lady''; %25color=#8b0000%25[[http://wantonwicked.gamingsandbox.com/wiki/index.php?n=Players.JesabellaWoodridge|Jesabella Woodridge]] %25color=#b95fa7%25is the unofficial benefactor of the chapel while Pastor William Green serves as the pastor of the assembly. Apart from holding sermons, the pair have been known to host community events, raise money to feed and clothe the poorest in society, and in other ways contribute to a safe, prospering, and pious neighborhood.%0a%3c [[%3c%3c]]%0a%3c %0a%3c %0a%3c %25color=#b95fa7%25 '''Resonance:''' Devout\\%0a%3c %25color=#b95fa7%25 '''Territory:''' %25color=#8b0000%25[[Players/Jesabella Woodridge]]%25color=#b95fa7%25, North Chatham Regent: %25color=#8b0000%25[[Players/Eliza Wilson]]%0a%3c [[#locationend]]%0a%3c %0a%3c ----%0a%3c (:include CityBook.Directory:)%0a\ No newline at end of file%0a
