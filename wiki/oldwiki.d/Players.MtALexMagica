Our steps are challenged by the Abyss, by enemies seen and unseen, by our own desires and our mortal flaws. We are Awakened, we persevere despite adversity; we are resilient, strong in mind and body, fortified with soul and will. Now we take the next step, we look to the future by founding a Consilium, a collection of like-minded Wise in the tradition of lost Atlantis.%0a> %0a> Now, as we establish ourselves, we follow in the traditions of those who came before us, paying respect to the methods and the works of our ancestors by path, by order and by blood. We establish that the city known as Savannah, and a protectorate of land around it, will be under the jurisdiction of the wise who reside here. Bordered by the Savannah River to our North and the Ogeechee River to the South, from the mighty Atlantic to our East to the area known as Skinner’s Bay to our West we now enact the Lex Magica of  the Consilium of Savannah Georgia, in this year 1742. Long may the watchtowers guide our steps.%0a> %0a> [--%25color=#365776%25[[#top| Back to top]]--]%0a> %0a> %0a> [[#Lex-2]]%0a> !!!The Savannah Charter%0a> %0a> Many roles are taken in the course of a mundane life, even more so upon Awakening. The titles we carry are our positions in society, both mundane and arcane. They are the badges of service that we wear, they denote the work we must perform for our society to flourish. The Consilium of Savannah will be conducted under the beneficial guidance of a Hierarch drawn from  any of the Diamond Orders (Changed to Pentacle Orders with the creation of the Free Council.) The Hierarch shall rise by merit, and not simple mastery, to lead the Wise in Savannah. The Hierarch will select a provost to aid them, to stand with them, and occasionally for them. Heralds and Sentinels will be drawn from the orders as needed, no order will have more than one of each, Herald or Sentinel, at one time. The Council of the Wise shall be comprised of the leaders of cabals within the city and the outlying protectorate of Savannah. Solitaires, will be protected, under the Lex and Apostasy will be discouraged without stigmata. Let all wise who follow the Lex exist under its Aegis. %0a> %0a> [--%25color=#365776%25[[#top| Back to top]]--]%0a> %0a> %0a> [[#Lex-3]]%0a> !!!Rights of the Awakened%0a> %0a> !!!!Obligations of the Wise to the Consilium of Savannah%0a> *All Awakened in the Savannah Consilium and its surrounding protectorate agree to the binding laws of the Lex Magica. The agreement to these honored laws will, in turn, protect the Wise from undue persecution, offering them representation and when accused, a voice when questioning and an Aegis from enemies of the Wise. Rejecting the Lex is rejecting its protection.%0a> %0a> *All Awakened agree to honor the Great Rights of other Awakened as proscribed by the Lex Magica.%0a> %0a> *All Awakened agree to keep the secrets of the Pentacle safe from its enemies, those named or those yet unnamed.%0a> %0a> *All Awakened will protect the Veil, the secrets of the wise will not be shared lightly. Our existence is not to be shared with others.%0a> %0a> *In times of war, in times of need, the Consilium can call upon the Awakened of Savannah to defend the city, the Consilium and and the wise from assault. This call to arms is a service to all the Awakened and should be considered a great honor to perform. Those who refuse to serve then refuse the Consilium’s protection during these troubled times.%0a> %0a> *The Awakened of Savannah may be called to testify, to provide witness for defense or prosecution of a trial. Cooperation is to be expected, all Awakened must acquit themselves to the best of their ability.  Refusal to do so is a disregarding of the responsibility of being among the Wise.%0a> %0a> *An Awakened may be required to provide a tithe of tass to the Consilium. This payment of tass could be for recognition and acceptance into the Consilium, for the establishment of territory as a solitaire or as a cabal, or could be required in the form of payment for a debt. Refusal to do so is a disregard of the responsibility of being among the Wise and standing within the Consilium could be affected by the unwillingness to contribute.%0a> %0a> %0a> !!!!Obligations of the Consilium to the Wise of Savannah%0a> %0a> *Representatives, Councilor or provost, of the established cabals of the Consilim shall meet monthly to discuss policy, ratify laws, make rulings in regards to the Lex Magica, mediate disputes between constituents, hear appeals, and levy punishments against offenders of the Lex.%0a> %0a> *During this time, the representative Councilors will recognize new Magi in the city, approve of new cabals and hear requests for territory within the city and the Protectorate. Also during this time, those who have served the Consilium will be recognized for their service.%0a> %0a> *The representatives of the cabals shall work with expediency. If a petitioning Wise has to wait more than a full season for an official response and ruling on their concern, the Council is expected to rule in the constituent’s favor.%0a> %0a> *The Consilium shall not move against an Awakened accused of a crime without a trial. The Council of cabals will provide the most neutral setting, with counsel for defense as well as counsel for the prosecution. There will be parity and equality, the innocence of the accused will exist, their wrongdoing must be proven.%0a> %0a> *The Consilium shall protect the Wise from unjust persecution. Any Wise in good standing may appeal to the Consilium at any time to appeal an invocation of the Great Right of Nemesis as being unjust and request intervention.%0a> %0a> *The Consilium shall protect its constituents from external threats. While the Consilium does not possess a standing army, it is expected to maintain healthy relations with the Pentacle Order heads and keep them appraised of all known threats, and if need be raise needed forces to repel attacks against the Consilium body.%0a> %0a> *The Consilium, like the individuals who are its body,  shall honor the Great Rights as laid out below in the Lex Magica.%0a> %0a> [--%25color=#365776%25[[#top| Back to top]]--]%0a> %0a> %0a> [[#Lex-4]]%0a> !!!Positions held by Player Characters%0a> !!!!Councilors%0a> (:toggle hide pcp-c button=1:)%0a> >>id=pcp-c border='1px solid #999' padding=5px bgcolor=#c5d8ee%3c%3c %0a> :Requirements:%0a> *The Councilor position is any head of a cabal that is recognized as being a member of the Consilium.%0a> *The cabal must have a minimum of three mages and be located in the city or the immediate area around the city.%0a> %0a> :Status:%0a> The Councilor will be give Consilium status 3 upon being recognized by the existing Council. %0a> *If a Councilor steps down in good standing they will get to keep 1 of the Consilium status dots for free. %0a> *If they are censured of forced out due to circumstances then they will lose all of these free dots.%0a> %0a> :Duties and Powers:Each Councilor has a single vote on all matters brought before the Consilium. This body will approve the amending of the Lex and are responsible for the day to day activities of the Consilium. This is the group that will approve territory, resolve minor disputes of territory, they will adjudicate public and personal offenses, decide on methods of protecting of sleepwalkers and so on. %0a> %0a> They are not order heads, they do not dictate order policy. %0a> %0a> Some of the powers of the Council are define as:%0a> %0a> 1) The passing of all amendments to the Lex that are crafted by the Factotums with a majority vote.%0a> %0a> 2) In the event that a Sentinel position becomes vacant due to loss, retirement or censure, the Council will vote in the next Sentinel to that position. The position is order specific, they cannot vote in 2 of any one order, instead each order must be represented. %0a> %0a> 3) If a Sentinel or Herald is censured then the Council appoints the appropriate time that the position must remain vacant. Time will be no greater than three months unless the crime is unspeakably heinous.%0a> %0a> 4) The Council has the right to call a vote of no confidence against an order head. If this happens the Council can remove an order head from their position due to abuse of power or a blatant breaking of the Lex Magica. This is a dangerous precedent and can only be accomplished with a unanimous Council vote.%0a> %0a> 5) The Council can censure other Council members though this does not remove them from their position has the head of their cabal. It does however strip them of Councilor status. If this happens then the Council can then also reduce the territory claimed by said cabal within reason. This has to happen with a majority vote. Examples of the reasons a vote may be called include willfully ignoring Council orders, breaking the Lex Magica, ignoring the positions of Herald, Sentinel or Order Head, or can be called due to inactivity within the Council itself. %0a> %0a> 6) The Council must recognize the Right of Nemesis before hostilities begin.%0a> %0a> :Expectations:%0a> Each time a cabal is formed they then come before the Council to be recognized. It is standard practice to accept the new cabal without question, to afford the new Councilor their position and badge to stand alongside their fellow councilors. It is a serious breach of etiquette to try and deny a new Councilor their status. %0a>  %0a> :Restrictions:A Councilor cannot hold a second office outside of Councilor. There are no combo Councilor/heralds or sentinels. %0a> %0a> :ST Note:This is a player driven game and the position of Councilor will allow those who are looking for their political game to get their trench warfare on. No character should be hamstrung waiting on an order head because the body of councilors will be doing a majority of the work. Unlike the core which suggests that the orders and the paths be the ruling Council it is more manageable and active to use councilors made of cabal heads. These are the groups that dictate the day to day policies and actions of the Consilium. It requires people who wish to be cabal heads to understand there is some work to be done. All of you have been in games where there is a cabal that is a paper tiger, only coming on to deal in politics and sometimes making a mess of things. This system will help combat that lethargy. You have to be active, your cabal has to be active for you to keep a vote. A majority vote keeps the process simple, the ability to remove other councilors and even an order head is a HUGE issue and should not be treated lightly. It’s difficult, but it can be done. It also allows for a realistic Consilium where not every mage and their brother need attend a meeting. This way you don’t have to scroll through 4 pages of chatter to get to the first question.%0a> %0a> I want you, the players, to define your Consilium, to define how the Lex is interpreted and applied in game. I want you to be the ones who fight for rules, laws, and mandates that are created by one another. This is another step in the process to offer you another tier in which to operate, to have allies and enemies. You will be encouraged to push order business through by way of the Herald, you will deal with one another and the masses by way of the Sentinel, you will police each other with your position as Councilor. %0a> >>%3c%3c%0a> %0a> !!!!Factotum%0a> (:toggle hide pcp-f button=1:)%0a> >>id=pcp-f border='1px solid #999' padding=5px bgcolor=#c5d8ee%3c%3c %0a> %0a> :Requirements:%0a> *Academics 3 (Specialty: Lex Magica)%0a> *Investigation 1%0a> *Occult 2%0a> *Politics 2%0a> *Persuasion 2%0a> *Mentor 1 (To represent the NPC who will teach the Lex and its interpretations and how to proceed with a case in front of the Consilium)%0a> *Patron: a member in their order or another other of at least one status higher than their current status.%0a> *Suggested but not required: Mind and Prime arcana%0a> Note: The Factotum is traditionally a Silver Ladder position, though it is not unheard of for other Orders to have a member who has passed the Silver Ladder tests.%0a> %0a> :Status:%0a> Silver Ladder characters will automatically gain status 2 as a Factotum, though they may not earn the other title associated with status 2 until later. They will be able to keep their mentor merit if they wish, or they can change the merit to Ally or Contact within the Silver Ladder.%0a> %0a> There is no automatic bump in status for non-Silver Ladder  characters who become Factotums. Upon graduation the mentor merit must be changed into either allies or contacts with the Silver Ladder at 1 dot.%0a> %0a> :Duties and Powers:%0a> For those with the Silver Ladder supplement, you might remember reading about the position of Factotum on page 77.. More than just a lawyer, the Factotum is a specialist who studies, argues, defends and creates amendments to the Lex Magica. There is no one universal Lex, instead each Consili has their own version, though many are similar in a multitude of ways. %0a> %0a> Factotums will be the only characters who will be able to deliberate and prosecute the Lex should an event come up that there needs to be a “trial” or a ruling on the Lex. Factotums will also have the ability to pen amendments to the Lex, essentially they will be counsel for those who wish to seek change. %0a> %0a> ‘’An example would be that the Free Council has decided a part of the Lex is outdated and they want to see a change. They would go to a Factotum, explain what their idea is, and the Factotum will pen an amendment. Once the amendment meets the needs of the Free Council, the Factotum can put it in front of the councilors and the Heads of the Orders for a vote to see if the amendment will be adopted. They will be able to speak to the Council and the Order heads in the defense of the Amendment.’’%0a> %0a> In this, the Factotum is not only the “lawyer” of the Consilium, but they are the representatives that propose change to the law. If an Order does not have a Factotum of their own, then they must seek one out from another order, and there could be some form of payment demanded for services. %0a> %0a> :Expectations:%0a> The process for any character wishing to become a Factotum is the same no matter what order they originate from. The character must secure a Patron. (This can be done with role-play, with an agreement of a debt or a favor, or it could be politically motivated by plot.) Once the character has a patron they then petition the Silver Ladder to be taken on as a student of the Lex.  Once this happens, the ST and the Player will set up an arrangement on how this will progress. %0a> %0a> Becoming a Factotum takes more than a month, but how much time it takes is up to the player and their investment. There are ways to condense time studying and an enterprising player will figure them out.%0a> %0a> When the time is ready for the Factotum test(s) it will be a scene run by the storyteller. If the test(s) is/ are not passed the player can choose to take them again in the future (some time will need to pass before that happens) or they can leave the study of the Lex.%0a> %0a> :ST Note:%0a> The political game will happen. As with all WoD splats, politics is part and parcel of the game. Personally, I like always keeping a knife under the robes when hanging out with senators, keeps you on your toes. The political game will exist for people who want it, but, remember that line from Constantine when Rachel Weisz says “I don’t believe in the Devil,” and Keanu ‘Whoa!’ Reeves responds with “Why not? He believes in you.” That is how politics will work, you may not want to play the political game, but you sure as hell can feel its effects. If someone does something politically that you do not like you cannot “opt out” of the effects, and what is more, spending willpower will not change the outcome for you. This said, you don’t have to play politics, make friends who like to play politics and develop a buffer.%0a> >>%3c%3c%0a> %0a> !!!!Herald%0a> (:toggle hide pcp-h button=1:)%0a> >>id=pcp-h border='1px solid #999' padding=5px bgcolor=#c5d8ee%3c%3c %0a> %0a> :Requirements:%0a> * Position appointed by Order head%0a> * No Herald can hold another position within the Consilium while performing the Herald duties. %0a> %0a> :Status:%0a> Heralds are given Consilium Status 2 for free, the status is tied to the position, should the Herald leave the position in good standing they will keep one dot as a reward. Should they be censured or leave under circumstance then they will lose these free dots.%0a> %0a> :Duties and Powers:%0a> This position is getting expanded but also defined in its role and its obligation. The Herald position will be the direct voice from the heads of each order to the Consilium, to the councilors of the cabals as well as the unaligned mages within the city. The Heralds operate with the seal and the approval of the order leaders, their word is the words of those on high. Characters will ignore this position at their own risk. %0a> %0a> Heralds will be able to enter cabal territory without announcement when on Consilium business. Furthermore they will be afforded the rite of hospitality due to their office. This gives them the right to impose for sanctuary. %0a> %0a> The Rite of Censure: Heralds will be able to censure councilors of the Consilium (by councilors I mean the heads of cabals,) sentinels, individual mages and potentially the heads of the various orders. This rite of censure is the political ability to “cap” another character’s status. %0a> %0a> :Expectations:%0a> Abuse of powers and duties will be dealt with harshly In Character: These abilities do not give the Herald cart blanche to be rude or demanding. In the case of the Rite of Censure, serious justification will be required. Such abuse could lead to the Herald being censured.%0a> %0a> If a Herald is censured, this is a blow to their respective order. Not only will the Herald in question be stripped of their title and their status but the order will lose the position for a number of months agreed upon by the councilors. While the Herald can censure councilors for abusing their power, so can the Herald be removed by the councilors for abuse of their power. During the time a Herald is censured the order has no voice of its own and must operate through other the Heralds from other orders. Needless to say, order agenda may get dicey at this point.%0a> %0a> :ST Note:%0a> A natural question will be, “what is stopping the order heads from operating directly with the councilors?” The answer is this, détente. Sure, an order head can speak with a Councilor of their own order without much though, but to speak with councilors of other orders, well, they need to be polite. The order heads are status 4 and 5 individuals but they are not above the Lex or the Consilium. The Herald acts as a conduit to and from lower status mages, and unaligned mages, because order heads do not always answer the messages left by status one or zero mages. %0a> %0a> The practical application of the Herald position gives a clear and concise chain of communication. You want business with an order head you go through a Herald or you have the Herald arrange a meeting. This should remove the wait for NPC’s for action. It drives the IC aspect of the political game. It removes some of potential ST Fiat and gives you more avenues to explore Role-play. %0a> >>%3c%3c%0a> %0a> !!!!Sentinel%0a> (:toggle hide pcp-s button=1:)%0a> >>id=pcp-s border='1px solid #999' padding=5px bgcolor=#c5d8ee%3c%3c %0a> %0a> :Requirements:%0a> *None, sentinels are voted into positions by councilors of the Consilium%0a> %0a> :Status:%0a> %0a> :Duties and Powers:%0a> Unlike the traditional concept of the “enforcer” of the Consilium, here the Sentinel is charged with keeping peace ‘’between’’ the cabals as well as serving as something more akin to a palace guard:%0a> *Make Consilium aware of threats and respond to those threats.%0a> *With Consilium approval, they may take a mage into custody for breaking the Lex or a Consilium mandate. %0a> *Bodyguards of order heads in official Consilium meetings and functions.%0a> *Sentinels may enter cabal territory with formal, prior announcement (calling beforehand) of their intention and reason for entering. They do not need the permission of the cabal when on Consilium business. They are expected to be afforded the Rite of Hospitality without question.%0a> *Witness to Duel Arcane:  To be recognized by the Council and the Orders as a valid and binding challenge, at least one Sentinel who is not a member of either combatant’s order, or cabal, must be a physical witness to the duel. It is the responsibility of the duelists to agree to a Sentinel and approach the Sentinel to witness the duel. The Sentinel is under no obligation to do so, thus preventing the duel if necessary.%0a> *May call a vote of no confidence on a Councilor. The sentinels will need to have a majority vote to enact this vote, and will have to develop and deliver this vote to the Consilium as a whole.%0a> %0a> :Expectations:%0a> There is no such thing a Sentinel’s “Citizen’s Arrest.” The Sentinel must be charged with a task by the Order heads or councilors of the Consilium. However, when detention is sanctioned by the Consilium, a mage is expected to submit to the Sentinel. This is not considered an admission of guilt.%0a> Abuse of power or duties will not be tolerated. Like a Herald, if a Sentinel is censured, it is a blow to the order. The Sentinel will be stripped of their title, their status and the order will lose the position for a number of months agreed upon by the councilors. They can be removed by the councilors for abuse of their power. During this time the order has no guard of its own and must operate through other sentinels and orders. %0a>  %0a> :Restrictions: No Sentinel can also be a Councilor or hold another position within the Consilium while performing the Sentinel duties.  Furthermore, a Sentinel should not be a Banner Warden for a cabal because their duty in Consilium functions will be to the Order Head of their order.%0a> :ST Note:%0a> %0a> ST Note: The Sentinel is not exactly a policeman, nor exactly a politician, but they sometimes fill these roles. The Sentinels look to make sure that violations of the Lex are met responsibly and with organization. Where the Guardians of the Veil protect the mortals from the Awakened, and the Arrow protects the Consilium and the mortals from external threats, the sentinels make sure that the Lex is followed and that mages are held responsible for their actions. Again, these positions are in place to remove the wait for NPC action on an event.%0a> >>%3c%3c%0a> %0a> [--%25color=#365776%25[[#top| Back to top]]--]%0a> %0a> %0a> [[#Lex-5]]%0a> !!!The Great Rights%0a> %0a> The Consilium recognizes the Great Rights, not only as Rights to be claimed by individual cabals, but as basic rights of all recognized constituent magi and the foundation for the Lex Magica. Any cabal or magi applying for territory is expected to inform the Consilium as to which of these rights they will honor in their territory; failure to do so is grounds for denial of the cabal or magi’s petition for territory. Any right a cabal or individual magi does not extend to others may be freely denied to them by other constituents (if cabal A doesn't honor the Right of Hospitality, cabal B is under no obligation to honor that Right for cabal A if they ask, even if cabal B usually does honor the Right of Hospitality).%0a> %0a> :The Right of Crossing: Let no borders stop an Awakened with a clear heart.%0a> Magi traveling through the territory of another may pass unmolested, provided the traveler refrains from practicing offensive magic in the territory he is passing through. The traveling time is expected to be succinct. Magi following this Right are not expected to guard their entire territory; instead, they are urged to mark 'Safe Paths' through their territory in coordination with the Cartographer. Magi found straying from the Safe Path shall be given a chance to get back on, given the benefit of the doubt that they might be lost. A magi found to be continually straying or found performing hostile magic may expect to be forcibly ejected from the territory and may be subject to a grievance brought before the Consilium by the offended cabal.%0a> %0a> :The Right of Emeritus: Those who have earned respect must be treated with respect.%0a> Individuals are free to interpret this Right as it suits them within their cabals. When applied towards interactions with the rest of the constituents of the Consilium and the Consilium’s officers, lack of respect given will almost always translate into lack of respect received, and repeated violators of this Right may find their actions a matter of public record. With a simple majority vote the Council may rule that a constituent who has repeatedly been reported for violating the Right of Emeritus may be publicly marked as an exception to the Right of Hospitality for a length of time, usually no longer than three months. No magi would suffer any consequences for denying it to the offender during that length of time.%0a> %0a> :The Right of Hospitality: Those who request hospitality must be granted it.%0a> When this Right is invoked by a visitor, a host must provide food and security to the visitor so that she may rest and recuperate. The Right protects a mage for a visit of a week in length. During this time, she is expected to be protected from threats both internal and external, given a roof over her head, and fed at least the bare minimum to keep a human adult alive. Serious, life-threatening wounds are to be treated to the extent that the mage's health is stabilized.%0a> %0a> :The Right of Nemesis: When vengeance is declared, let none stand in his way.%0a> When constituent magi clash, no others should interfere unless the feud becomes a direct threat to them, their territories, their sanctums, or Sleepers under their care. The Right of Nemesis must be formally declared to the Warden and Historian in order to be honored by the Consilium. The Council may intercede at their discretion if the conflict grows out of control or if one or both parties appeals to them for arbitration.%0a> %0a> :The Right of Sanctuary: Protect your home, and let no action cause it harm.%0a> Constituents are free to set parameters of behavior for residents and guests within their territories. Violations of these parameters may result in the host revoking the Right of Hospitality. Outright attacks on a constituent's sanctum or hallow may be responded to in kind, and in fact is valid grounds for invoking the Right of Nemesis.%0a> %0a> [--%25color=#365776%25[[#top| Back to top]]--]%0a> %0a> %0a> [[#Lex-6]]%0a> !!!The Common Precepts%0a> %0a> Beyond the Great Rights, the Consilium holds the following to be law, and all constituents bound by it regardless of path or order.%0a> %0a> !!!!Precept of Secrecy%0a> Due to the dangers of vulgar magic and disbelief, the existence of magic must be kept secret from those who do not practice it. Divulging these secrets can potentially compromise the security of the rest of the Consilium and Pentacle society at large. Therefore;%0a> %0a> No constituent may cast vulgar magic before Sleeper witnesses. Any magi found guilty of violating this law shall be given a Major Reprimand at minimum, subject to stricter punishment with repeat offenses, or if the Sleeper witness manages to pass along what they have seen to others, at which point a Major Penance is recommended.%0a> %0a> No constituent may leave evidence of magic having been performed, or leave magic or a miracle as one of the only explanations for a given scenario. For example, if a magi is imprisoned by Sleeper authorities and simply decides to teleport out of their cell in the middle of the night, that magi might be in violation of this law guards were posted in the hallway the entire evening. The recommended punishment for this violation is a Minor Penance.%0a> %0a> No constituent may speak of the Mysteries before Sleepers. Doing so has potentially contributed to the creation of witch-hunters and Banishers in the past, and potentially endangers other magi. The recommended punishment for this violation is Imprisonment of a length determined by the High Council.%0a> %0a> No constituent may attempt to teach Sleepers the Mysteries. Efforts in this field have proven futile over thousands of years, and it is foolhardy to try. At best, the magi risks the Sleeper's sanity. At worst, the magi risks the lives of other magi. The recommended punishment for this violation is Banishment of a length determined by the High Council.%0a> %0a> No Constituent may betray Arcane knowledge to other non-Pentacle supernatural societies. Banishers wish only to annihilate magic and its practitioners. Seers wish only to enslave Sleepers and keep the Mysteries for themselves and their Exarch masters. Other secret societies of magi and stranger things might have other agendas as sinister as the Seers. The recommended punishment for this violation is Banishment of a length determined by the High Council.%0a> %0a> !!!!Precept of Recognition%0a> The Consilium shall record all formal punishments, as well as the actions and circumstances leading to those punishments. These records shall be used as precedent for all future prosecutions of similar crimes. A crime that is recognized might not be punished, but the transgression must still be recorded.%0a> %0a> All magi who reside within the Consilium’s claimed borders must abide by the Consilium’s laws.  A magi or cabal who wishes to be recognized as willing to abide by its laws and support the Consilium must present themselves in person to the Council. They shall be asked for a simple declaration of their shadow name, the Path he has walked, a brief description of the journey, and the name of his Order. cabals shall be asked to make these introductions in addition to outlining requested territory. Each Councilor is then permitted to ask one question of the magi. If pressed for time, the Councilors may elect to ask their question of an entire cabal as a collective unit rather than each individual magi. After the formalities are complete, the Council shall vote; a simple majority is all that is required to recognize a magi or a cabal.%0a> %0a> A magi's sanctum, if recognized by the Council, is generally no longer secret, but its standards at the time of its recognition are accepted as legal.%0a> %0a> !!!!Precept of Protectorate%0a> Any recognized territory or sanctum falls under the auspices of the Precept of Protectorate. Constituent magi are not required to divulge the locations of their sanctums. However, hiding such knowledge from the Ruling Council is a rejection of the Council's help with future catastrophes when the constituent's sanctum would normally require assistance.%0a> %0a> A magi who shares such information may expect a certain degree of protection. During times of emergency, the Ruling Council may offer to help magically fortify constituent sanctums (with the permission of the resident magi).%0a> %0a> The Council does not expect a petitioner to approach them for redress every time a trespasser from another Order walks through their neighborhood, nor should a mage take offense every time a mage approaches his door and merely knocks without sending a proper introduction. However, repeated or more grievous violations should be brought before the Consilium.%0a> %0a> No constituent may enter the territory or approach the sanctum of another constituent unannounced and without stating their destination and intention. A simple phone call will do. While traversing a constituent's territory via a Safe Path is perfectly acceptable and does not require announcement, any straying from this path requires announcement. The resident constituent may deny the request for any reason. The only exceptions occur with Heralds and Sentinels (see Heralds and Sentinels in the Charter for their powers and limitations in regards to this right). The recommended punishment for this transgression is a Minor Reprimand.%0a> %0a> No constituent may, intentionally or not, cause a Sleeper investigation within sight of another mage's sanctum. The potential exists for the mage's sanctum to fall under Sleeper scrutiny, which might create an unacceptable breach of the precept of secrecy. The recommended punishment for this transgression is a Major Reprimand.%0a> %0a> No constituent may test the wards or limits of another mage's sanctum. Such behavior almost invariably leads to retaliation, which weakens the fiber and focus of the Protectorate. The recommended punishment for this transgression is a Minor Penance.%0a> %0a> No constituent may enter the sanctum of another mage without permission. A mage's sanctum is a home and an assured place of privacy. Mages who violate this precept by intruding into another mage's sanctum can expect to have their capability to intrude to be taken from them. The recommended punishment for this transgression is Incarceration of a length of time determined by the Ruling Council, but not to exceed one month except in the case of repeated violations.%0a> %0a> No constituent may initiate a magical attack against another mage's sanctum. If the wronged mage brings it before the Ruling Council for trial, the Ruling Council may levy a punishment as if the mage had intruded upon the sanctum, as well as requiring a Payment of Debt from the guilty party to the petitioner. Alternatively, the wronged mage is within their rights to declare Nemesis, and the Ruling Council may repeal the Precept of Protectorate in regards to the offending magi's own sanctum.%0a> %0a> !!!!Precept of Hubris%0a> Legislating morality has historically been shaky ground. When dealing with beings capable of altering reality on a whim, however, we must bind ourselves to commonly agreed upon codes of behavior and agree upon actions that tarnish and dishonor the great power and responsibility we have been given. Therefore;%0a> %0a> No constituent shall perform the following against another constituent magi; casting a curse, forcing an unwilling transformation, binding another's soul, magical attacks (unless performed within a sanctioned Duel Arcane), or aiding in spiritual possession. Magi will always disagree on some point or another, and in some cases disagreements can become heated to the point of violence. Using magic as a tool for assault is worthy of censure, as it is irresponsible and does not further the goals of the Pentacle. The recommended punishment for these transgressions is a Minor Reprimand, with punishments for repeated violations subject to the offender’s history and the High Council's discretion.%0a> %0a> No constituent shall perform the following against a sleepwalker or sleeper; casting a curse, forcing an unwilling transformation, binding another's soul, magical attacks, or aiding in spiritual possession. Such actions threaten the Precept of Secrecy and should be swiftly stopped. The wounds and scars that result often act as evidence that sorcery is real. Furthermore, sleepers and sleepwalkers, unlike magi, are incapable of defending themselves from most of these assaults. Such tyranny should be left to the servants of the Lie while the Pentacle holds itself to a higher standard. The recommended punishment for these transgressions is a Severe Reprimand, with punishments for repeated violations subject to the offender’s history and the High Council's discretion.%0a> %0a> No constituent shall perform the following against another constituent magi; exiling to the Shadow Realm, murder (magical or otherwise), or soul theft. These actions weaken the Protectorate and should not be tolerated. The recommended punishment for these transgressions will be fitting of the crime, with punishments of increasing severity appearing for repeated violations subject to the offender’s history and the High Council's discretion.%0a> %0a> No constituent shall perform the following against sleepwalkers or sleepers; exiling to the Shadow Realm, murder (magical or otherwise), or soul theft. If lesser assault against a sleeper is worse than a lesser assault against a magi, then it logically follows that these greater assaults carry a heavier punishment when inflicted upon sleepwalkers and sleepers. The recommended punishment for these transgressions is Incarceration, with punishments for repeated violations subject to the offender’s history and the High Council's discretion.%0a> %0a> No constituent shall attempt to force a sleeper or sleepwalker to awaken. In the thousands of years our predecessors were practicing magic, no means of deliberately making contact with a supernal watchtower, even on anothers behalf, has been discovered. If that were the case, the Seers would be a thing of the past. Given the unusually high number of Sleepwalkers in Providence and the fact that some of them have painful or violent reactions to proximate magic, doing things such as repeatedly casting magic around them with the intent to force them to awaken shall be looked upon as magical assault. At best, it will only create an awakened mage that distrusts or even hates the Pentacle. At worst, it will create a dead sleepwalker or a Banisher. The recommended punishment for this transgression is a Severe Reprimand, with punishments for repeated violations subject to the offender’s history and the High Council's discretion.%0a> %0a> !!!!Precept of War%0a> One of the Consilium’s functions is to peacefully resolve conflicts between constituent magi. When the system works, both parties agree with the outcome of the trial. When the system doesn't work, one party may be so discontent with the decision that they decide to take matters into their own hands.%0a> %0a> A petitioner or a representative of the petitioning cabal must appear before the Council, petitioning them to accept her or her cabal's temporary withdrawal from their system of law. The mage must testify to the actions that the other party has taken against her or her cabal. With a 2/3 majority vote, the Council can decide to formally proceed by invoking the Precept of War. If the Council does not, then the petitioner shall be informed that no matter what she claims, the Council will treat her like any other magi in the city, passing judgment on her actions if anyone files a complaint.%0a> %0a> If the Precept of War is invoked, the petitioner shall announce the limits of their aggression. Alternatively, the Council may with a simple majority vote set limits on the level of aggression or dispatch Sentinels to break up the fight if it spins out of control.%0a> %0a> Even under conditions of war, combatants will still be held to the Precepts of Secrecy.%0a> %0a> Limits of aggression, or rules of engagement, are as follows:%0a> %0a> :Street Warfare: The cabal announces that it will attack but not violate the sanctity of its rivals’ sanctum.%0a> %0a> :Spiritual Warfare: The cabal announces that they intend to use open magic in the Shadow Realm, an invitation to “take the fight outside,” so Sleepers needn’t witness it.%0a> %0a> :Sanctum Warfare: The cabal confides in the Consilium that it intends to strike back at its rivals’ sanctum. The cabal-members do not expect any redress or compensation for the retaliation that must inevitably follow.%0a> %0a> :Shadow Warfare: The cabal chooses to confide that they are striking against another supernatural society. They acknowledge that they alone are responsible, and they must personally bear responsibility for the backlash that follows.%0a> %0a> :The Duel Arcane: The cabal wants to send a champion against their rivals’ champion to conduct single combat, so that greater bloodshed can be prevented.%0a> %0a> [--%25color=#365776%25[[#top| Back to top]]--]%0a> %0a> %0a> [[#Lex-7]]%0a> !!!Right to Trial%0a> %0a> Any recognized magi can bring an accusation of breaking the Lex against another magi. All recognized magi are entitled to a trial. If a Sleeper has been victimized by a mage's actions, any recognized mage who witnessed the crime or has evidence of it may file a grievance against the offender. If a mage has been victimized (and survived), the Consilium requires the victim to appear before the Council to state their grievance. In the event that the victim is deceased or otherwise incapable of giving testimony, the Council may instead hear grievance from a representative of the victim's cabal or order.%0a> %0a> After the initial hearing, the Council must decide whether they must rely on precedents set in the Lex Magica to resolve the issue. In the event there is cause for a trial, or a punishment of any kind, the accused has the right to be defended by a Factotum.  Minor transgressions may only warrant a warning or a formal announcement, but relying upon the Lex also means that the transgression must be logged and recorded according to the Precept of Recognition and then becomes part of the precedents of the Lex. Any further transgressions committed by a guilty mage must be evaluated in light of this transgression.%0a> %0a> The hearing shall begin with a dialogue between the Councilors, among the points discussed being whether or not this crime has been punished under the Lex before. A truly unique crime could lead to a trial if the Protectorate has never seen its like, in which case the opening dialogue shall acknowledge that the trial may be proceeding without precedent in order to give everyone involved extra time to search for any precedent or illumination that may affect the outcome of the trial. A simple majority vote of the Ruling Council is all that is needed to begin a trial under the auspices of the Lex.%0a> %0a> The Council must then wait at least 24 hours before beginning the trial, but may wait no longer than a month. This gives the Council flexibility to schedule multiple trials over the course of a day if they need to.%0a> %0a> The Council must consider the nature of the trial. In cases involving the city's Sentinels or Guardians of the Veil, evidence might need to be kept secret. A 2/3 majority vote is required to keep the proceedings of the trial secret.%0a> %0a> The mage who brought the case to trial – the Petitioner – may choose a Factotum to represent him, usually called an Advocate. The Advocate doesn't serve as a lawyer, but if he accepts, he has several responsibilities to the Petitioner. First, witnesses: if the petitioner requires witnesses, the Advocate decides the means by which they are brought before the Council. A simple request should do. Failure to appear before the Consilium may be taken as a rejection of the Consilium, along with its justice and protection. In cases involving serious crimes (anything worthy of a punishment beyond a major penance), Sentinels may be tasked with bringing in witnesses against their will.%0a> %0a> The Advocate must then approach the accused and summon them before Consilium. The trial may proceed anyway without the cooperation of the accused. The Accused and/or the Petitioner may appoint a Factotum from their order to speak on their behalf. If the Accused or Petitioner has no suitable Factotum in their order, then they may negotiate with other Pentacle Orders for the use of their Factotum, provided no conflict of interest is created.%0a> %0a> The trial, at the discretion of the Council, can require the Petitioner, Accused, and any Factotums to attend. It also might involve some or none of them, depending on whether the proceedings are secret. Regardless, the trial must be held in a venue neutral to both the Petitioner and the Accused, and it is the Council's duty to find such a place.%0a> %0a> Once the mages are assembled, the trial shall open with a brief ritual invoking the Lex. The High Council shall act as the jury while the Hierarch acts as the judge. The trial shall be conducted in a manner similar to that of a U.S. Court. The Petitioner and the Accused (or their Factotums) will begin by stating their cases, and then they shall call their witnesses. The opposing side may cross-examine witnesses. Any Councilor is free to use magic to aid in discerning the truth.%0a> %0a> Once both the Accused and Petitioner have rested their cases, each Councilor may then have the podium to express their opinion and cite precedents and luminaries that should influence the decision. Once each Councilor has had a chance to state their opinion, all of the High Councilors retire to decide the verdict. A simple majority is required to decide to punish the accused.%0a> %0a> The High Council will then return and face the Accused and Petitioner, if present. They will render verdict. At this time, any Councilors may take the podium and suggest suitable punishment. After all Councilors have had their say the Hierarch will pass sentence, as well as determine who will be responsible for enforcing the sentence.%0a> %0a> [--%25color=#365776%25[[#top| Back to top]]--]%0a> %0a> %0a> [[#Lex-8]]%0a> !!!Punishments: The 10 Letters of the Tetragrammaton%0a> %0a> The degrees of punishment listed below are known among western magi as the 10 Letters of the Tetragrammaton. They are listed here in order of degree of severity.%0a> %0a> Every punishment levied shall have a specified duration, known as a stigma. By tradition, a stigma usually corresponds to a natural or mystical phenomena: from dusk till dawn, the phase of the moon or a lunar cycle, and so on. More precise terms for stigmas, such as calendar days, weeks, or months, are also acceptable.%0a> %0a> :Minor Reprimand:%0a> The Council, through the Historian and the Heralds, issues a formal statement that it frowns upon the actions of the offender. While no further action may be taken at this time, the incident is recorded and archived by the Historian, and may be used as cause for more severe punishment in the event of further or repeat transgressions.%0a> %0a> :Major Reprimand:%0a> The Council requests that all officers of the Orders and the Consilium limit their assistance to the offender. In some cases, the Councilors may even warn other cabals or mages against helping the criminal.%0a> %0a> :Payment of Debt:%0a> The offender must pay a debt, usually in the form of a favor, act or deed, to the wronged party. Alternatively, the offender might take up a debt that the wronged party owes to another. The nature of the repayment as well as the timetable for executing repayment is determined by the High Council.%0a> %0a> :Minor Penance:%0a> The offender must atone for her act by performing a service for the Consilium. The nature of the task is left up to the High Council and should not be a dangerous task; merely laborous.%0a> %0a> :Major Penance:%0a> The offender must perform a risky or dangerous act for the benefit of the Consilium. The High Council determines the nature of the task and the timetable for completion.%0a> %0a> :Severe Reprimand:%0a> The Consilium states bluntly that no one (not even initiates) may aid or assist the offending mage, clarifying the duration of the reprimand. Offering assistance merits the same punishment, “tarring” the collaborator “with the same brush.” The mage is then either instructed to meditate in seclusion or abstain from practicing magic. Failure to comply leads to incarceration.%0a> %0a> :Incarceration:%0a> The offender is magically confined, surrounded by powerful wards that cripple his magical power and guarded by the Warden and his Sentinels. The offender must meditate on his actions. The High Council determines the length of the incarceration and whether or not the incarcerated shall be allowed visitors.%0a> %0a> :Banishment:%0a> This may sometimes be used as an alternative to incarceration. The offender is given orders to leave the city, sometimes for a specific period of time. If she returns during that time, she faces incarceration or worse. The stigma can include further details of where the mage must go or what she must do before she returns, as dictated by the High Council.%0a> %0a> :Spiritual Scourging (Confinement or Banishment):This punishment has only been performed ten times since the founding of the current Consilium in the early 1950s. A master of Death can steal an Awakened soul. When carrying out a sentence of spiritual confinement, the master of Death binds a mage’s soul in a protected place for the duration of a stigma before restoring it to its owner. When performing a rite of spiritual banishment, the master sends the soul far away. This may involve hurling it into the Shadow Realm or instructing the Warden or Executor to carry it to another city. Spiritual banishment often results in a quest, as the mage must either chase down the soul herself or find allies who can do so for her.%0a> %0a> :Spiritual Oblivion:This punishment has only been performed once before in the Consilium’s history; the Hierarch responsible for passing sentence immediately resigned once the business as concluded, along with the Guardian High Councilor and the Executor. The offender’s very soul is destroyed, rendering him incapable of performing magic. Sentencing a mage in this fashion — and actually performing the spiritual execution — is still a punishable offense under the Lex.%0a> %0a> [--%25color=#365776%25[[#top| Back to top]]--]%0a> %0a> (:table cellpadding=5:)%0a> (:cell bgcolor=#004a80 width=175 align=center:)%25white%25Acknowledgement:%0a> (:cell:)A significant amount of this Lex Magica was unrepentantly cribbed from the Lex Magic/Council Charter of Providence with the knowledge and permission of author Nosferajew (2009).%0a> (:tableend:)%0a> %0a

Our steps are challenged by the Abyss, by enemies seen and unseen, by our own desires and our mortal flaws. We are Awakened, we persevere despite adversity; we are resilient, strong in mind and body, fortified with soul and will. Now we take the next step, we look to the future by founding a Consilium, a collection of like-minded Wise in the tradition of lost Atlantis.%0a%3c %0a%3c Now, as we establish ourselves, we follow in the traditions of those who came before us, paying respect to the methods and the works of our ancestors by path, by order and by blood. We establish that the city known as Savannah, and a protectorate of land around it, will be under the jurisdiction of the wise who reside here. Bordered by the Savannah River to our North and the Ogeechee River to the South, from the mighty Atlantic to our East to the area known as Skinner’s Bay to our West we now enact the Lex Magica of  the Consilium of Savannah Georgia, in this year 1742. Long may the watchtowers guide our steps.%0a%3c %0a%3c [--%25color=#365776%25[[#top| Back to top]]--]%0a%3c %0a%3c %0a%3c [[#Lex-2]]%0a%3c !!!The Savannah Charter%0a%3c %0a%3c Many roles are taken in the course of a mundane life, even more so upon Awakening. The titles we carry are our positions in society, both mundane and arcane. They are the badges of service that we wear, they denote the work we must perform for our society to flourish. The Consilium of Savannah will be conducted under the beneficial guidance of a Hierarch drawn from  any of the Diamond Orders (Changed to Pentacle Orders with the creation of the Free Council.) The Hierarch shall rise by merit, and not simple mastery, to lead the Wise in Savannah. The Hierarch will select a provost to aid them, to stand with them, and occasionally for them. Heralds and Sentinels will be drawn from the orders as needed, no order will have more than one of each, Herald or Sentinel, at one time. The Council of the Wise shall be comprised of the leaders of cabals within the city and the outlying protectorate of Savannah. Solitaires, will be protected, under the Lex and Apostasy will be discouraged without stigmata. Let all wise who follow the Lex exist under its Aegis. %0a%3c %0a%3c [--%25color=#365776%25[[#top| Back to top]]--]%0a%3c %0a%3c %0a%3c [[#Lex-3]]%0a%3c !!!Rights of the Awakened%0a%3c %0a%3c !!!!Obligations of the Wise to the Consilium of Savannah%0a%3c *All Awakened in the Savannah Consilium and its surrounding protectorate agree to the binding laws of the Lex Magica. The agreement to these honored laws will, in turn, protect the Wise from undue persecution, offering them representation and when accused, a voice when questioning and an Aegis from enemies of the Wise. Rejecting the Lex is rejecting its protection.%0a%3c %0a%3c *All Awakened agree to honor the Great Rights of other Awakened as proscribed by the Lex Magica.%0a%3c %0a%3c *All Awakened agree to keep the secrets of the Pentacle safe from its enemies, those named or those yet unnamed.%0a%3c %0a%3c *All Awakened will protect the Veil, the secrets of the wise will not be shared lightly. Our existence is not to be shared with others.%0a%3c %0a%3c *In times of war, in times of need, the Consilium can call upon the Awakened of Savannah to defend the city, the Consilium and and the wise from assault. This call to arms is a service to all the Awakened and should be considered a great honor to perform. Those who refuse to serve then refuse the Consilium’s protection during these troubled times.%0a%3c %0a%3c *The Awakened of Savannah may be called to testify, to provide witness for defense or prosecution of a trial. Cooperation is to be expected, all Awakened must acquit themselves to the best of their ability.  Refusal to do so is a disregarding of the responsibility of being among the Wise.%0a%3c %0a%3c *An Awakened may be required to provide a tithe of tass to the Consilium. This payment of tass could be for recognition and acceptance into the Consilium, for the establishment of territory as a solitaire or as a cabal, or could be required in the form of payment for a debt. Refusal to do so is a disregard of the responsibility of being among the Wise and standing within the Consilium could be affected by the unwillingness to contribute.%0a%3c %0a%3c %0a%3c !!!!Obligations of the Consilium to the Wise of Savannah%0a%3c %0a%3c *Representatives, Councilor or provost, of the established cabals of the Consilim shall meet monthly to discuss policy, ratify laws, make rulings in regards to the Lex Magica, mediate disputes between constituents, hear appeals, and levy punishments against offenders of the Lex.%0a%3c %0a%3c *During this time, the representative Councilors will recognize new Magi in the city, approve of new cabals and hear requests for territory within the city and the Protectorate. Also during this time, those who have served the Consilium will be recognized for their service.%0a%3c %0a%3c *The representatives of the cabals shall work with expediency. If a petitioning Wise has to wait more than a full season for an official response and ruling on their concern, the Council is expected to rule in the constituent’s favor.%0a%3c %0a%3c *The Consilium shall not move against an Awakened accused of a crime without a trial. The Council of cabals will provide the most neutral setting, with counsel for defense as well as counsel for the prosecution. There will be parity and equality, the innocence of the accused will exist, their wrongdoing must be proven.%0a%3c %0a%3c *The Consilium shall protect the Wise from unjust persecution. Any Wise in good standing may appeal to the Consilium at any time to appeal an invocation of the Great Right of Nemesis as being unjust and request intervention.%0a%3c %0a%3c *The Consilium shall protect its constituents from external threats. While the Consilium does not possess a standing army, it is expected to maintain healthy relations with the Pentacle Order heads and keep them appraised of all known threats, and if need be raise needed forces to repel attacks against the Consilium body.%0a%3c %0a%3c *The Consilium, like the individuals who are its body,  shall honor the Great Rights as laid out below in the Lex Magica.%0a%3c %0a%3c [--%25color=#365776%25[[#top| Back to top]]--]%0a%3c %0a%3c %0a%3c [[#Lex-4]]%0a%3c !!!Positions held by Player Characters%0a%3c !!!!Councilors%0a%3c (:toggle hide pcp-c button=1:)%0a%3c >>id=pcp-c border='1px solid #999' padding=5px bgcolor=#c5d8ee%3c%3c %0a%3c :Requirements:%0a%3c *The Councilor position is any head of a cabal that is recognized as being a member of the Consilium.%0a%3c *The cabal must have a minimum of three mages and be located in the city or the immediate area around the city.%0a%3c %0a%3c :Status:%0a%3c The Councilor will be give Consilium status 3 upon being recognized by the existing Council. %0a%3c *If a Councilor steps down in good standing they will get to keep 1 of the Consilium status dots for free. %0a%3c *If they are censured of forced out due to circumstances then they will lose all of these free dots.%0a%3c %0a%3c :Duties and Powers:Each Councilor has a single vote on all matters brought before the Consilium. This body will approve the amending of the Lex and are responsible for the day to day activities of the Consilium. This is the group that will approve territory, resolve minor disputes of territory, they will adjudicate public and personal offenses, decide on methods of protecting of sleepwalkers and so on. %0a%3c %0a%3c They are not order heads, they do not dictate order policy. %0a%3c %0a%3c Some of the powers of the Council are define as:%0a%3c %0a%3c 1) The passing of all amendments to the Lex that are crafted by the Factotums with a majority vote.%0a%3c %0a%3c 2) In the event that a Sentinel position becomes vacant due to loss, retirement or censure, the Council will vote in the next Sentinel to that position. The position is order specific, they cannot vote in 2 of any one order, instead each order must be represented. %0a%3c %0a%3c 3) If a Sentinel or Herald is censured then the Council appoints the appropriate time that the position must remain vacant. Time will be no greater than three months unless the crime is unspeakably heinous.%0a%3c %0a%3c 4) The Council has the right to call a vote of no confidence against an order head. If this happens the Council can remove an order head from their position due to abuse of power or a blatant breaking of the Lex Magica. This is a dangerous precedent and can only be accomplished with a unanimous Council vote.%0a%3c %0a%3c 5) The Council can censure other Council members though this does not remove them from their position has the head of their cabal. It does however strip them of Councilor status. If this happens then the Council can then also reduce the territory claimed by said cabal within reason. This has to happen with a majority vote. Examples of the reasons a vote may be called include willfully ignoring Council orders, breaking the Lex Magica, ignoring the positions of Herald, Sentinel or Order Head, or can be called due to inactivity within the Council itself. %0a%3c %0a%3c 6) The Council must recognize the Right of Nemesis before hostilities begin.%0a%3c %0a%3c :Expectations:%0a%3c Each time a cabal is formed they then come before the Council to be recognized. It is standard practice to accept the new cabal without question, to afford the new Councilor their position and badge to stand alongside their fellow councilors. It is a serious breach of etiquette to try and deny a new Councilor their status. %0a%3c  %0a%3c :Restrictions:A Councilor cannot hold a second office outside of Councilor. There are no combo Councilor/heralds or sentinels. %0a%3c %0a%3c :ST Note:This is a player driven game and the position of Councilor will allow those who are looking for their political game to get their trench warfare on. No character should be hamstrung waiting on an order head because the body of councilors will be doing a majority of the work. Unlike the core which suggests that the orders and the paths be the ruling Council it is more manageable and active to use councilors made of cabal heads. These are the groups that dictate the day to day policies and actions of the Consilium. It requires people who wish to be cabal heads to understand there is some work to be done. All of you have been in games where there is a cabal that is a paper tiger, only coming on to deal in politics and sometimes making a mess of things. This system will help combat that lethargy. You have to be active, your cabal has to be active for you to keep a vote. A majority vote keeps the process simple, the ability to remove other councilors and even an order head is a HUGE issue and should not be treated lightly. It’s difficult, but it can be done. It also allows for a realistic Consilium where not every mage and their brother need attend a meeting. This way you don’t have to scroll through 4 pages of chatter to get to the first question.%0a%3c %0a%3c I want you, the players, to define your Consilium, to define how the Lex is interpreted and applied in game. I want you to be the ones who fight for rules, laws, and mandates that are created by one another. This is another step in the process to offer you another tier in which to operate, to have allies and enemies. You will be encouraged to push order business through by way of the Herald, you will deal with one another and the masses by way of the Sentinel, you will police each other with your position as Councilor. %0a%3c >>%3c%3c%0a%3c %0a%3c !!!!Factotum%0a%3c (:toggle hide pcp-f button=1:)%0a%3c >>id=pcp-f border='1px solid #999' padding=5px bgcolor=#c5d8ee%3c%3c %0a%3c %0a%3c :Requirements:%0a%3c *Academics 3 (Specialty: Lex Magica)%0a%3c *Investigation 1%0a%3c *Occult 2%0a%3c *Politics 2%0a%3c *Persuasion 2%0a%3c *Mentor 1 (To represent the NPC who will teach the Lex and its interpretations and how to proceed with a case in front of the Consilium)%0a%3c *Patron: a member in their order or another other of at least one status higher than their current status.%0a%3c *Suggested but not required: Mind and Prime arcana%0a%3c Note: The Factotum is traditionally a Silver Ladder position, though it is not unheard of for other Orders to have a member who has passed the Silver Ladder tests.%0a%3c %0a%3c :Status:%0a%3c Silver Ladder characters will automatically gain status 2 as a Factotum, though they may not earn the other title associated with status 2 until later. They will be able to keep their mentor merit if they wish, or they can change the merit to Ally or Contact within the Silver Ladder.%0a%3c %0a%3c There is no automatic bump in status for non-Silver Ladder  characters who become Factotums. Upon graduation the mentor merit must be changed into either allies or contacts with the Silver Ladder at 1 dot.%0a%3c %0a%3c :Duties and Powers:%0a%3c For those with the Silver Ladder supplement, you might remember reading about the position of Factotum on page 77.. More than just a lawyer, the Factotum is a specialist who studies, argues, defends and creates amendments to the Lex Magica. There is no one universal Lex, instead each Consili has their own version, though many are similar in a multitude of ways. %0a%3c %0a%3c Factotums will be the only characters who will be able to deliberate and prosecute the Lex should an event come up that there needs to be a “trial” or a ruling on the Lex. Factotums will also have the ability to pen amendments to the Lex, essentially they will be counsel for those who wish to seek change. %0a%3c %0a%3c ‘’An example would be that the Free Council has decided a part of the Lex is outdated and they want to see a change. They would go to a Factotum, explain what their idea is, and the Factotum will pen an amendment. Once the amendment meets the needs of the Free Council, the Factotum can put it in front of the councilors and the Heads of the Orders for a vote to see if the amendment will be adopted. They will be able to speak to the Council and the Order heads in the defense of the Amendment.’’%0a%3c %0a%3c In this, the Factotum is not only the “lawyer” of the Consilium, but they are the representatives that propose change to the law. If an Order does not have a Factotum of their own, then they must seek one out from another order, and there could be some form of payment demanded for services. %0a%3c %0a%3c :Expectations:%0a%3c The process for any character wishing to become a Factotum is the same no matter what order they originate from. The character must secure a Patron. (This can be done with role-play, with an agreement of a debt or a favor, or it could be politically motivated by plot.) Once the character has a patron they then petition the Silver Ladder to be taken on as a student of the Lex.  Once this happens, the ST and the Player will set up an arrangement on how this will progress. %0a%3c %0a%3c Becoming a Factotum takes more than a month, but how much time it takes is up to the player and their investment. There are ways to condense time studying and an enterprising player will figure them out.%0a%3c %0a%3c When the time is ready for the Factotum test(s) it will be a scene run by the storyteller. If the test(s) is/ are not passed the player can choose to take them again in the future (some time will need to pass before that happens) or they can leave the study of the Lex.%0a%3c %0a%3c :ST Note:%0a%3c The political game will happen. As with all WoD splats, politics is part and parcel of the game. Personally, I like always keeping a knife under the robes when hanging out with senators, keeps you on your toes. The political game will exist for people who want it, but, remember that line from Constantine when Rachel Weisz says “I don’t believe in the Devil,” and Keanu ‘Whoa!’ Reeves responds with “Why not? He believes in you.” That is how politics will work, you may not want to play the political game, but you sure as hell can feel its effects. If someone does something politically that you do not like you cannot “opt out” of the effects, and what is more, spending willpower will not change the outcome for you. This said, you don’t have to play politics, make friends who like to play politics and develop a buffer.%0a%3c >>%3c%3c%0a%3c %0a%3c !!!!Herald%0a%3c (:toggle hide pcp-h button=1:)%0a%3c >>id=pcp-h border='1px solid #999' padding=5px bgcolor=#c5d8ee%3c%3c %0a%3c %0a%3c :Requirements:%0a%3c * Position appointed by Order head%0a%3c * No Herald can hold another position within the Consilium while performing the Herald duties. %0a%3c %0a%3c :Status:%0a%3c Heralds are given Consilium Status 2 for free, the status is tied to the position, should the Herald leave the position in good standing they will keep one dot as a reward. Should they be censured or leave under circumstance then they will lose these free dots.%0a%3c %0a%3c :Duties and Powers:%0a%3c This position is getting expanded but also defined in its role and its obligation. The Herald position will be the direct voice from the heads of each order to the Consilium, to the councilors of the cabals as well as the unaligned mages within the city. The Heralds operate with the seal and the approval of the order leaders, their word is the words of those on high. Characters will ignore this position at their own risk. %0a%3c %0a%3c Heralds will be able to enter cabal territory without announcement when on Consilium business. Furthermore they will be afforded the rite of hospitality due to their office. This gives them the right to impose for sanctuary. %0a%3c %0a%3c The Rite of Censure: Heralds will be able to censure councilors of the Consilium (by councilors I mean the heads of cabals,) sentinels, individual mages and potentially the heads of the various orders. This rite of censure is the political ability to “cap” another character’s status. %0a%3c %0a%3c :Expectations:%0a%3c Abuse of powers and duties will be dealt with harshly In Character: These abilities do not give the Herald cart blanche to be rude or demanding. In the case of the Rite of Censure, serious justification will be required. Such abuse could lead to the Herald being censured.%0a%3c %0a%3c If a Herald is censured, this is a blow to their respective order. Not only will the Herald in question be stripped of their title and their status but the order will lose the position for a number of months agreed upon by the councilors. While the Herald can censure councilors for abusing their power, so can the Herald be removed by the councilors for abuse of their power. During the time a Herald is censured the order has no voice of its own and must operate through other the Heralds from other orders. Needless to say, order agenda may get dicey at this point.%0a%3c %0a%3c :ST Note:%0a%3c A natural question will be, “what is stopping the order heads from operating directly with the councilors?” The answer is this, détente. Sure, an order head can speak with a Councilor of their own order without much though, but to speak with councilors of other orders, well, they need to be polite. The order heads are status 4 and 5 individuals but they are not above the Lex or the Consilium. The Herald acts as a conduit to and from lower status mages, and unaligned mages, because order heads do not always answer the messages left by status one or zero mages. %0a%3c %0a%3c The practical application of the Herald position gives a clear and concise chain of communication. You want business with an order head you go through a Herald or you have the Herald arrange a meeting. This should remove the wait for NPC’s for action. It drives the IC aspect of the political game. It removes some of potential ST Fiat and gives you more avenues to explore Role-play. %0a%3c >>%3c%3c%0a%3c %0a%3c !!!!Sentinel%0a%3c (:toggle hide pcp-s button=1:)%0a%3c >>id=pcp-s border='1px solid #999' padding=5px bgcolor=#c5d8ee%3c%3c %0a%3c %0a%3c :Requirements:%0a%3c *None, sentinels are voted into positions by councilors of the Consilium%0a%3c %0a%3c :Status:%0a%3c %0a%3c :Duties and Powers:%0a%3c Unlike the traditional concept of the “enforcer” of the Consilium, here the Sentinel is charged with keeping peace ‘’between’’ the cabals as well as serving as something more akin to a palace guard:%0a%3c *Make Consilium aware of threats and respond to those threats.%0a%3c *With Consilium approval, they may take a mage into custody for breaking the Lex or a Consilium mandate. %0a%3c *Bodyguards of order heads in official Consilium meetings and functions.%0a%3c *Sentinels may enter cabal territory with formal, prior announcement (calling beforehand) of their intention and reason for entering. They do not need the permission of the cabal when on Consilium business. They are expected to be afforded the Rite of Hospitality without question.%0a%3c *Witness to Duel Arcane:  To be recognized by the Council and the Orders as a valid and binding challenge, at least one Sentinel who is not a member of either combatant’s order, or cabal, must be a physical witness to the duel. It is the responsibility of the duelists to agree to a Sentinel and approach the Sentinel to witness the duel. The Sentinel is under no obligation to do so, thus preventing the duel if necessary.%0a%3c *May call a vote of no confidence on a Councilor. The sentinels will need to have a majority vote to enact this vote, and will have to develop and deliver this vote to the Consilium as a whole.%0a%3c %0a%3c :Expectations:%0a%3c There is no such thing a Sentinel’s “Citizen’s Arrest.” The Sentinel must be charged with a task by the Order heads or councilors of the Consilium. However, when detention is sanctioned by the Consilium, a mage is expected to submit to the Sentinel. This is not considered an admission of guilt.%0a%3c Abuse of power or duties will not be tolerated. Like a Herald, if a Sentinel is censured, it is a blow to the order. The Sentinel will be stripped of their title, their status and the order will lose the position for a number of months agreed upon by the councilors. They can be removed by the councilors for abuse of their power. During this time the order has no guard of its own and must operate through other sentinels and orders. %0a%3c  %0a%3c :Restrictions: No Sentinel can also be a Councilor or hold another position within the Consilium while performing the Sentinel duties.  Furthermore, a Sentinel should not be a Banner Warden for a cabal because their duty in Consilium functions will be to the Order Head of their order.%0a%3c :ST Note:%0a%3c %0a%3c ST Note: The Sentinel is not exactly a policeman, nor exactly a politician, but they sometimes fill these roles. The Sentinels look to make sure that violations of the Lex are met responsibly and with organization. Where the Guardians of the Veil protect the mortals from the Awakened, and the Arrow protects the Consilium and the mortals from external threats, the sentinels make sure that the Lex is followed and that mages are held responsible for their actions. Again, these positions are in place to remove the wait for NPC action on an event.%0a%3c >>%3c%3c%0a%3c %0a%3c [--%25color=#365776%25[[#top| Back to top]]--]%0a%3c %0a%3c %0a%3c [[#Lex-5]]%0a%3c !!!The Great Rights%0a%3c %0a%3c The Consilium recognizes the Great Rights, not only as Rights to be claimed by individual cabals, but as basic rights of all recognized constituent magi and the foundation for the Lex Magica. Any cabal or magi applying for territory is expected to inform the Consilium as to which of these rights they will honor in their territory; failure to do so is grounds for denial of the cabal or magi’s petition for territory. Any right a cabal or individual magi does not extend to others may be freely denied to them by other constituents (if cabal A doesn't honor the Right of Hospitality, cabal B is under no obligation to honor that Right for cabal A if they ask, even if cabal B usually does honor the Right of Hospitality).%0a%3c %0a%3c :The Right of Crossing: Let no borders stop an Awakened with a clear heart.%0a%3c Magi traveling through the territory of another may pass unmolested, provided the traveler refrains from practicing offensive magic in the territory he is passing through. The traveling time is expected to be succinct. Magi following this Right are not expected to guard their entire territory; instead, they are urged to mark 'Safe Paths' through their territory in coordination with the Cartographer. Magi found straying from the Safe Path shall be given a chance to get back on, given the benefit of the doubt that they might be lost. A magi found to be continually straying or found performing hostile magic may expect to be forcibly ejected from the territory and may be subject to a grievance brought before the Consilium by the offended cabal.%0a%3c %0a%3c :The Right of Emeritus: Those who have earned respect must be treated with respect.%0a%3c Individuals are free to interpret this Right as it suits them within their cabals. When applied towards interactions with the rest of the constituents of the Consilium and the Consilium’s officers, lack of respect given will almost always translate into lack of respect received, and repeated violators of this Right may find their actions a matter of public record. With a simple majority vote the Council may rule that a constituent who has repeatedly been reported for violating the Right of Emeritus may be publicly marked as an exception to the Right of Hospitality for a length of time, usually no longer than three months. No magi would suffer any consequences for denying it to the offender during that length of time.%0a%3c %0a%3c :The Right of Hospitality: Those who request hospitality must be granted it.%0a%3c When this Right is invoked by a visitor, a host must provide food and security to the visitor so that she may rest and recuperate. The Right protects a mage for a visit of a week in length. During this time, she is expected to be protected from threats both internal and external, given a roof over her head, and fed at least the bare minimum to keep a human adult alive. Serious, life-threatening wounds are to be treated to the extent that the mage's health is stabilized.%0a%3c %0a%3c :The Right of Nemesis: When vengeance is declared, let none stand in his way.%0a%3c When constituent magi clash, no others should interfere unless the feud becomes a direct threat to them, their territories, their sanctums, or Sleepers under their care. The Right of Nemesis must be formally declared to the Warden and Historian in order to be honored by the Consilium. The Council may intercede at their discretion if the conflict grows out of control or if one or both parties appeals to them for arbitration.%0a%3c %0a%3c :The Right of Sanctuary: Protect your home, and let no action cause it harm.%0a%3c Constituents are free to set parameters of behavior for residents and guests within their territories. Violations of these parameters may result in the host revoking the Right of Hospitality. Outright attacks on a constituent's sanctum or hallow may be responded to in kind, and in fact is valid grounds for invoking the Right of Nemesis.%0a%3c %0a%3c [--%25color=#365776%25[[#top| Back to top]]--]%0a%3c %0a%3c %0a%3c [[#Lex-6]]%0a%3c !!!The Common Precepts%0a%3c %0a%3c Beyond the Great Rights, the Consilium holds the following to be law, and all constituents bound by it regardless of path or order.%0a%3c %0a%3c !!!!Precept of Secrecy%0a%3c Due to the dangers of vulgar magic and disbelief, the existence of magic must be kept secret from those who do not practice it. Divulging these secrets can potentially compromise the security of the rest of the Consilium and Pentacle society at large. Therefore;%0a%3c %0a%3c No constituent may cast vulgar magic before Sleeper witnesses. Any magi found guilty of violating this law shall be given a Major Reprimand at minimum, subject to stricter punishment with repeat offenses, or if the Sleeper witness manages to pass along what they have seen to others, at which point a Major Penance is recommended.%0a%3c %0a%3c No constituent may leave evidence of magic having been performed, or leave magic or a miracle as one of the only explanations for a given scenario. For example, if a magi is imprisoned by Sleeper authorities and simply decides to teleport out of their cell in the middle of the night, that magi might be in violation of this law guards were posted in the hallway the entire evening. The recommended punishment for this violation is a Minor Penance.%0a%3c %0a%3c No constituent may speak of the Mysteries before Sleepers. Doing so has potentially contributed to the creation of witch-hunters and Banishers in the past, and potentially endangers other magi. The recommended punishment for this violation is Imprisonment of a length determined by the High Council.%0a%3c %0a%3c No constituent may attempt to teach Sleepers the Mysteries. Efforts in this field have proven futile over thousands of years, and it is foolhardy to try. At best, the magi risks the Sleeper's sanity. At worst, the magi risks the lives of other magi. The recommended punishment for this violation is Banishment of a length determined by the High Council.%0a%3c %0a%3c No Constituent may betray Arcane knowledge to other non-Pentacle supernatural societies. Banishers wish only to annihilate magic and its practitioners. Seers wish only to enslave Sleepers and keep the Mysteries for themselves and their Exarch masters. Other secret societies of magi and stranger things might have other agendas as sinister as the Seers. The recommended punishment for this violation is Banishment of a length determined by the High Council.%0a%3c %0a%3c !!!!Precept of Recognition%0a%3c The Consilium shall record all formal punishments, as well as the actions and circumstances leading to those punishments. These records shall be used as precedent for all future prosecutions of similar crimes. A crime that is recognized might not be punished, but the transgression must still be recorded.%0a%3c %0a%3c All magi who reside within the Consilium’s claimed borders must abide by the Consilium’s laws.  A magi or cabal who wishes to be recognized as willing to abide by its laws and support the Consilium must present themselves in person to the Council. They shall be asked for a simple declaration of their shadow name, the Path he has walked, a brief description of the journey, and the name of his Order. cabals shall be asked to make these introductions in addition to outlining requested territory. Each Councilor is then permitted to ask one question of the magi. If pressed for time, the Councilors may elect to ask their question of an entire cabal as a collective unit rather than each individual magi. After the formalities are complete, the Council shall vote; a simple majority is all that is required to recognize a magi or a cabal.%0a%3c %0a%3c A magi's sanctum, if recognized by the Council, is generally no longer secret, but its standards at the time of its recognition are accepted as legal.%0a%3c %0a%3c !!!!Precept of Protectorate%0a%3c Any recognized territory or sanctum falls under the auspices of the Precept of Protectorate. Constituent magi are not required to divulge the locations of their sanctums. However, hiding such knowledge from the Ruling Council is a rejection of the Council's help with future catastrophes when the constituent's sanctum would normally require assistance.%0a%3c %0a%3c A magi who shares such information may expect a certain degree of protection. During times of emergency, the Ruling Council may offer to help magically fortify constituent sanctums (with the permission of the resident magi).%0a%3c %0a%3c The Council does not expect a petitioner to approach them for redress every time a trespasser from another Order walks through their neighborhood, nor should a mage take offense every time a mage approaches his door and merely knocks without sending a proper introduction. However, repeated or more grievous violations should be brought before the Consilium.%0a%3c %0a%3c No constituent may enter the territory or approach the sanctum of another constituent unannounced and without stating their destination and intention. A simple phone call will do. While traversing a constituent's territory via a Safe Path is perfectly acceptable and does not require announcement, any straying from this path requires announcement. The resident constituent may deny the request for any reason. The only exceptions occur with Heralds and Sentinels (see Heralds and Sentinels in the Charter for their powers and limitations in regards to this right). The recommended punishment for this transgression is a Minor Reprimand.%0a%3c %0a%3c No constituent may, intentionally or not, cause a Sleeper investigation within sight of another mage's sanctum. The potential exists for the mage's sanctum to fall under Sleeper scrutiny, which might create an unacceptable breach of the precept of secrecy. The recommended punishment for this transgression is a Major Reprimand.%0a%3c %0a%3c No constituent may test the wards or limits of another mage's sanctum. Such behavior almost invariably leads to retaliation, which weakens the fiber and focus of the Protectorate. The recommended punishment for this transgression is a Minor Penance.%0a%3c %0a%3c No constituent may enter the sanctum of another mage without permission. A mage's sanctum is a home and an assured place of privacy. Mages who violate this precept by intruding into another mage's sanctum can expect to have their capability to intrude to be taken from them. The recommended punishment for this transgression is Incarceration of a length of time determined by the Ruling Council, but not to exceed one month except in the case of repeated violations.%0a%3c %0a%3c No constituent may initiate a magical attack against another mage's sanctum. If the wronged mage brings it before the Ruling Council for trial, the Ruling Council may levy a punishment as if the mage had intruded upon the sanctum, as well as requiring a Payment of Debt from the guilty party to the petitioner. Alternatively, the wronged mage is within their rights to declare Nemesis, and the Ruling Council may repeal the Precept of Protectorate in regards to the offending magi's own sanctum.%0a%3c %0a%3c !!!!Precept of Hubris%0a%3c Legislating morality has historically been shaky ground. When dealing with beings capable of altering reality on a whim, however, we must bind ourselves to commonly agreed upon codes of behavior and agree upon actions that tarnish and dishonor the great power and responsibility we have been given. Therefore;%0a%3c %0a%3c No constituent shall perform the following against another constituent magi; casting a curse, forcing an unwilling transformation, binding another's soul, magical attacks (unless performed within a sanctioned Duel Arcane), or aiding in spiritual possession. Magi will always disagree on some point or another, and in some cases disagreements can become heated to the point of violence. Using magic as a tool for assault is worthy of censure, as it is irresponsible and does not further the goals of the Pentacle. The recommended punishment for these transgressions is a Minor Reprimand, with punishments for repeated violations subject to the offender’s history and the High Council's discretion.%0a%3c %0a%3c No constituent shall perform the following against a sleepwalker or sleeper; casting a curse, forcing an unwilling transformation, binding another's soul, magical attacks, or aiding in spiritual possession. Such actions threaten the Precept of Secrecy and should be swiftly stopped. The wounds and scars that result often act as evidence that sorcery is real. Furthermore, sleepers and sleepwalkers, unlike magi, are incapable of defending themselves from most of these assaults. Such tyranny should be left to the servants of the Lie while the Pentacle holds itself to a higher standard. The recommended punishment for these transgressions is a Severe Reprimand, with punishments for repeated violations subject to the offender’s history and the High Council's discretion.%0a%3c %0a%3c No constituent shall perform the following against another constituent magi; exiling to the Shadow Realm, murder (magical or otherwise), or soul theft. These actions weaken the Protectorate and should not be tolerated. The recommended punishment for these transgressions will be fitting of the crime, with punishments of increasing severity appearing for repeated violations subject to the offender’s history and the High Council's discretion.%0a%3c %0a%3c No constituent shall perform the following against sleepwalkers or sleepers; exiling to the Shadow Realm, murder (magical or otherwise), or soul theft. If lesser assault against a sleeper is worse than a lesser assault against a magi, then it logically follows that these greater assaults carry a heavier punishment when inflicted upon sleepwalkers and sleepers. The recommended punishment for these transgressions is Incarceration, with punishments for repeated violations subject to the offender’s history and the High Council's discretion.%0a%3c %0a%3c No constituent shall attempt to force a sleeper or sleepwalker to awaken. In the thousands of years our predecessors were practicing magic, no means of deliberately making contact with a supernal watchtower, even on anothers behalf, has been discovered. If that were the case, the Seers would be a thing of the past. Given the unusually high number of Sleepwalkers in Providence and the fact that some of them have painful or violent reactions to proximate magic, doing things such as repeatedly casting magic around them with the intent to force them to awaken shall be looked upon as magical assault. At best, it will only create an awakened mage that distrusts or even hates the Pentacle. At worst, it will create a dead sleepwalker or a Banisher. The recommended punishment for this transgression is a Severe Reprimand, with punishments for repeated violations subject to the offender’s history and the High Council's discretion.%0a%3c %0a%3c !!!!Precept of War%0a%3c One of the Consilium’s functions is to peacefully resolve conflicts between constituent magi. When the system works, both parties agree with the outcome of the trial. When the system doesn't work, one party may be so discontent with the decision that they decide to take matters into their own hands.%0a%3c %0a%3c A petitioner or a representative of the petitioning cabal must appear before the Council, petitioning them to accept her or her cabal's temporary withdrawal from their system of law. The mage must testify to the actions that the other party has taken against her or her cabal. With a 2/3 majority vote, the Council can decide to formally proceed by invoking the Precept of War. If the Council does not, then the petitioner shall be informed that no matter what she claims, the Council will treat her like any other magi in the city, passing judgment on her actions if anyone files a complaint.%0a%3c %0a%3c If the Precept of War is invoked, the petitioner shall announce the limits of their aggression. Alternatively, the Council may with a simple majority vote set limits on the level of aggression or dispatch Sentinels to break up the fight if it spins out of control.%0a%3c %0a%3c Even under conditions of war, combatants will still be held to the Precepts of Secrecy.%0a%3c %0a%3c Limits of aggression, or rules of engagement, are as follows:%0a%3c %0a%3c :Street Warfare: The cabal announces that it will attack but not violate the sanctity of its rivals’ sanctum.%0a%3c %0a%3c :Spiritual Warfare: The cabal announces that they intend to use open magic in the Shadow Realm, an invitation to “take the fight outside,” so Sleepers needn’t witness it.%0a%3c %0a%3c :Sanctum Warfare: The cabal confides in the Consilium that it intends to strike back at its rivals’ sanctum. The cabal-members do not expect any redress or compensation for the retaliation that must inevitably follow.%0a%3c %0a%3c :Shadow Warfare: The cabal chooses to confide that they are striking against another supernatural society. They acknowledge that they alone are responsible, and they must personally bear responsibility for the backlash that follows.%0a%3c %0a%3c :The Duel Arcane: The cabal wants to send a champion against their rivals’ champion to conduct single combat, so that greater bloodshed can be prevented.%0a%3c %0a%3c [--%25color=#365776%25[[#top| Back to top]]--]%0a%3c %0a%3c %0a%3c [[#Lex-7]]%0a%3c !!!Right to Trial%0a%3c %0a%3c Any recognized magi can bring an accusation of breaking the Lex against another magi. All recognized magi are entitled to a trial. If a Sleeper has been victimized by a mage's actions, any recognized mage who witnessed the crime or has evidence of it may file a grievance against the offender. If a mage has been victimized (and survived), the Consilium requires the victim to appear before the Council to state their grievance. In the event that the victim is deceased or otherwise incapable of giving testimony, the Council may instead hear grievance from a representative of the victim's cabal or order.%0a%3c %0a%3c After the initial hearing, the Council must decide whether they must rely on precedents set in the Lex Magica to resolve the issue. In the event there is cause for a trial, or a punishment of any kind, the accused has the right to be defended by a Factotum.  Minor transgressions may only warrant a warning or a formal announcement, but relying upon the Lex also means that the transgression must be logged and recorded according to the Precept of Recognition and then becomes part of the precedents of the Lex. Any further transgressions committed by a guilty mage must be evaluated in light of this transgression.%0a%3c %0a%3c The hearing shall begin with a dialogue between the Councilors, among the points discussed being whether or not this crime has been punished under the Lex before. A truly unique crime could lead to a trial if the Protectorate has never seen its like, in which case the opening dialogue shall acknowledge that the trial may be proceeding without precedent in order to give everyone involved extra time to search for any precedent or illumination that may affect the outcome of the trial. A simple majority vote of the Ruling Council is all that is needed to begin a trial under the auspices of the Lex.%0a%3c %0a%3c The Council must then wait at least 24 hours before beginning the trial, but may wait no longer than a month. This gives the Council flexibility to schedule multiple trials over the course of a day if they need to.%0a%3c %0a%3c The Council must consider the nature of the trial. In cases involving the city's Sentinels or Guardians of the Veil, evidence might need to be kept secret. A 2/3 majority vote is required to keep the proceedings of the trial secret.%0a%3c %0a%3c The mage who brought the case to trial – the Petitioner – may choose a Factotum to represent him, usually called an Advocate. The Advocate doesn't serve as a lawyer, but if he accepts, he has several responsibilities to the Petitioner. First, witnesses: if the petitioner requires witnesses, the Advocate decides the means by which they are brought before the Council. A simple request should do. Failure to appear before the Consilium may be taken as a rejection of the Consilium, along with its justice and protection. In cases involving serious crimes (anything worthy of a punishment beyond a major penance), Sentinels may be tasked with bringing in witnesses against their will.%0a%3c %0a%3c The Advocate must then approach the accused and summon them before Consilium. The trial may proceed anyway without the cooperation of the accused. The Accused and/or the Petitioner may appoint a Factotum from their order to speak on their behalf. If the Accused or Petitioner has no suitable Factotum in their order, then they may negotiate with other Pentacle Orders for the use of their Factotum, provided no conflict of interest is created.%0a%3c %0a%3c The trial, at the discretion of the Council, can require the Petitioner, Accused, and any Factotums to attend. It also might involve some or none of them, depending on whether the proceedings are secret. Regardless, the trial must be held in a venue neutral to both the Petitioner and the Accused, and it is the Council's duty to find such a place.%0a%3c %0a%3c Once the mages are assembled, the trial shall open with a brief ritual invoking the Lex. The High Council shall act as the jury while the Hierarch acts as the judge. The trial shall be conducted in a manner similar to that of a U.S. Court. The Petitioner and the Accused (or their Factotums) will begin by stating their cases, and then they shall call their witnesses. The opposing side may cross-examine witnesses. Any Councilor is free to use magic to aid in discerning the truth.%0a%3c %0a%3c Once both the Accused and Petitioner have rested their cases, each Councilor may then have the podium to express their opinion and cite precedents and luminaries that should influence the decision. Once each Councilor has had a chance to state their opinion, all of the High Councilors retire to decide the verdict. A simple majority is required to decide to punish the accused.%0a%3c %0a%3c The High Council will then return and face the Accused and Petitioner, if present. They will render verdict. At this time, any Councilors may take the podium and suggest suitable punishment. After all Councilors have had their say the Hierarch will pass sentence, as well as determine who will be responsible for enforcing the sentence.%0a%3c %0a%3c [--%25color=#365776%25[[#top| Back to top]]--]%0a%3c %0a%3c %0a%3c [[#Lex-8]]%0a%3c !!!Punishments: The 10 Letters of the Tetragrammaton%0a%3c %0a%3c The degrees of punishment listed below are known among western magi as the 10 Letters of the Tetragrammaton. They are listed here in order of degree of severity.%0a%3c %0a%3c Every punishment levied shall have a specified duration, known as a stigma. By tradition, a stigma usually corresponds to a natural or mystical phenomena: from dusk till dawn, the phase of the moon or a lunar cycle, and so on. More precise terms for stigmas, such as calendar days, weeks, or months, are also acceptable.%0a%3c %0a%3c :Minor Reprimand:%0a%3c The Council, through the Historian and the Heralds, issues a formal statement that it frowns upon the actions of the offender. While no further action may be taken at this time, the incident is recorded and archived by the Historian, and may be used as cause for more severe punishment in the event of further or repeat transgressions.%0a%3c %0a%3c :Major Reprimand:%0a%3c The Council requests that all officers of the Orders and the Consilium limit their assistance to the offender. In some cases, the Councilors may even warn other cabals or mages against helping the criminal.%0a%3c %0a%3c :Payment of Debt:%0a%3c The offender must pay a debt, usually in the form of a favor, act or deed, to the wronged party. Alternatively, the offender might take up a debt that the wronged party owes to another. The nature of the repayment as well as the timetable for executing repayment is determined by the High Council.%0a%3c %0a%3c :Minor Penance:%0a%3c The offender must atone for her act by performing a service for the Consilium. The nature of the task is left up to the High Council and should not be a dangerous task; merely laborous.%0a%3c %0a%3c :Major Penance:%0a%3c The offender must perform a risky or dangerous act for the benefit of the Consilium. The High Council determines the nature of the task and the timetable for completion.%0a%3c %0a%3c :Severe Reprimand:%0a%3c The Consilium states bluntly that no one (not even initiates) may aid or assist the offending mage, clarifying the duration of the reprimand. Offering assistance merits the same punishment, “tarring” the collaborator “with the same brush.” The mage is then either instructed to meditate in seclusion or abstain from practicing magic. Failure to comply leads to incarceration.%0a%3c %0a%3c :Incarceration:%0a%3c The offender is magically confined, surrounded by powerful wards that cripple his magical power and guarded by the Warden and his Sentinels. The offender must meditate on his actions. The High Council determines the length of the incarceration and whether or not the incarcerated shall be allowed visitors.%0a%3c %0a%3c :Banishment:%0a%3c This may sometimes be used as an alternative to incarceration. The offender is given orders to leave the city, sometimes for a specific period of time. If she returns during that time, she faces incarceration or worse. The stigma can include further details of where the mage must go or what she must do before she returns, as dictated by the High Council.%0a%3c %0a%3c :Spiritual Scourging (Confinement or Banishment):This punishment has only been performed ten times since the founding of the current Consilium in the early 1950s. A master of Death can steal an Awakened soul. When carrying out a sentence of spiritual confinement, the master of Death binds a mage’s soul in a protected place for the duration of a stigma before restoring it to its owner. When performing a rite of spiritual banishment, the master sends the soul far away. This may involve hurling it into the Shadow Realm or instructing the Warden or Executor to carry it to another city. Spiritual banishment often results in a quest, as the mage must either chase down the soul herself or find allies who can do so for her.%0a%3c %0a%3c :Spiritual Oblivion:This punishment has only been performed once before in the Consilium’s history; the Hierarch responsible for passing sentence immediately resigned once the business as concluded, along with the Guardian High Councilor and the Executor. The offender’s very soul is destroyed, rendering him incapable of performing magic. Sentencing a mage in this fashion — and actually performing the spiritual execution — is still a punishable offense under the Lex.%0a%3c %0a%3c [--%25color=#365776%25[[#top| Back to top]]--]%0a%3c %0a%3c (:table cellpadding=5:)%0a%3c (:cell bgcolor=#004a80 width=175 align=center:)%25white%25Acknowledgement:%0a%3c (:cell:)A significant amount of this Lex Magica was unrepentantly cribbed from the Lex Magic/Council Charter of Providence with the knowledge and permission of author Nosferajew (2009).%0a%3c (:tableend:)%0a%3c %0a%3c %0a%3c (:Include CityBook.MageNavigationBar:)%0a\ No newline at end of file%0a
