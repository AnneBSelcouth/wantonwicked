He's resided in Savannah since the summer of 1988, and for most of that time has been a well-known, if reluctantly tolerated, troublemaker for the Circle of the Crone. Setting himself up as a sort of flashy evangelist for the Dark Mother, Damian is known to bitterly oppose the Lancea Sanctum.  While this dislike is a theological matter, not personal, he's made a fair amount of trouble for the Sanctified over the years.%0a%0aA few years ago, Damian resurrected his musical career and formed a new band, Brother Basilisk.  They remained a local fixture, building a serious following in Savannah and the nearby area, but refraining from a national presence except via Internet downloads.  This changed in late December, 2012.  Just as the city's Kindred government fell into chaos, Brother Basilisk set out on a grueling, open-ended tour. Where most Kindred never travel for more than a night, Damian spent ten long months on the road, enduring the risks and hardship of a nomadic Requiem, undergoing at the same time a tremendous inner alchemy.  He returned to Savannah in October of 2013, shortly before Samhain, a changed vampire.  Those who have known him for years see the difference in him immediately. Gone is the sly trickster's gleam in his eye. In its place is the cold, knowing gaze of a serpent.%0a[[%3c%3c]]%0a%0a%25%25http://wantonwicked.gamingsandbox.com/wiki/images/vtr/headers/vtr_rph.png%0a'''Sex, Drugs, and Rock and Roll''' -- Damian is known for leading as much of a rock and roll "lifestyle" as one can in Savannah.  Manic concerts, raucous parties, and drug-fueled orgies are all part of the Damian Nero experience.  Perhaps you're a fan?  A local devotee who's been to every show?  Shared a hazy night with your favorite singer?  Brother Basilisk just came back from almost a year on tour -- perhaps you saw them in another city?%0a%0a'''Ties of Blood and Spirit''' -- Damian values loyalty very highly.  He's a devoted Acolyte, and since his return has treated the Circle with even greater respect.  He views all members of the Circle as brothers and sisters, blood-soaked children of the same Dark Mother.  He's also a Ventrue, an aspect of his identity he's only recently begun to take seriously. Since his own bloodline has run true, he's developed a greater interest in cultivating ties with other Lords.%0a%0a'''Don't Give a Damn About My Reputation''' -- Except for the last year, Damian's spent his entire Requiem in Savannah.  He's been a fixture in the city, and anyone who's also been here likely knows of him, and has almost certainly heard stories.  His past behavior hasn't endeared him to many establishment types, but perhaps among the younger rabble-rousers, his reputation is more favorable.%0a[[%3c%3c]]%0a%0a%25%25http://wantonwicked.gamingsandbox.com/wiki/images/vtr/headers/vtr_con.png%0a''Place your Allies, Contacts, Mentors and PC relationships here.''%0a[[%3c%3c]]%0a%0a%25%25http://wantonwicked.gamingsandbox.com/wiki/images/vtr/headers/vtr_q.png%0a''"Tell me what you think about me, because I know you think about me"'' - '''[[Damian Nero]]'''%0a[[%3c%3c]]%0a%0a''Any artist that makes his audience perform for him, while he watches from the stage... well he has my absolute admiration.
