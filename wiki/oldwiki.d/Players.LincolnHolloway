Indeed, it seems that the somewhat painful etiquette of his bloodline and station have overcome the proclivities of passion that are the trademark of Clan Daeva. He is polite, some might argue to a fault. Those who care to dig deeper, however, find that this is all a rather elaborate cage to keep a very vicious monster at bay. %0a%0a%25color=#9c9c9c%25Standing a touch over six feet, Sir Holloway is often a rather imposing figure. He is handsome, sure, but not the kind of unbearable perfection that is found in many of his clanmates. Everything about him is well-kept, meticulously so. His dark brunette hair is always styled, his face always just barely peppered with stubble. He wears impeccably tailored suits. In fact, everything about him is so manicured that it is almost off-putting, as if he is trying too hard. Wherever he goes, he carries a long pool cue case beneath one arm.%0a%0a[[%3c%3c]]%0a%0a(:cellnr colspan=3 width=380 bgcolor=#000 align=center:)%0a%25%25http://i.imgur.com/X5ahaK4.gif%0a%25color=#9c9c9c%25 %0a(:cellnr colspan=3 width=380 bgcolor=#000 align=right:)%0a%25%25http://nokturnis.net/graphics/wanton/storyhooks.jpg%0a(:cellnr colspan=3 width=380 bgcolor=#000 align=left:)%0a%25lfloat text-align=center margin-top=5px margin-right=15px margin-bottom=5px margin-left=0px%25http://nokturnis.net/graphics/wanton/spacer3.jpg%0a%25rfloat text-align=center margin-top=5px margin-right=0px margin-bottom=5px margin-left=15px%25http://nokturnis.net/graphics/wanton/spacer3.jpg%0a%25color=#9c9c9c%25 '''Citizen for Life (Kindred):''' %25color=#9c9c9c%25 ''Lincoln has been a member of Savannah's Danse Macabre since before the turn of the millennium.
