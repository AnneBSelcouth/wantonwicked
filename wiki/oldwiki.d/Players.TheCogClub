The club got its start a few years ago and seamlessly blends the era of invention with the quirkiness of perceived future.  %0a%0aThe club is 18+ and is not your normal nightspot.  A dress code is strictly enforced and as soon as you make it through the front door you are transported to an ethereal re-imagination of the Victorian area.  The building and decor is simply art and patrons can choose several areas to indulge in.%0a%0a'''Dress Code:'''  The Cog Club is dedicated to a resurgence of old world style and sense of romance that once dominated the idealistic nightlife of times past.  Thus innovative, sophisticated and/or cultured attire is required.  %0a%0a%0a%25center%25http://i800.photobucket.com/albums/yy287/eatmyexhaust/Cain/mainbar_zps56972de6.png%0aUpon getting past the bouncer and entering the double doors, a hostess, clad in Steam Punk attire, will greet you and ask if you have any reservations.  The hostess stand is on a landing pad that has stairs going up and down.  The stairs leading up are closed off with a heavy curtain and a set of doors that are access controlled.  %0a%0aIt is of note that anyone who has a card passed out by Cain, Able or Evelyn could so their card at this juncture to proceed to the VIP area. %0a%0aShould you choose to enter the club proper, you descend two flights of stairs into the Main Bar.  The Cog's venue space is quite large, which is surprising.  One could surmise that the pair bought several buildings at street level and converted down as well as up.  There are two general use bars, but this one is the largest.%0a%0a%25center%25%25width=190px%25[[http://i800.photobucket.com/albums/yy287/eatmyexhaust/Cain/CogClub/edison_entry_view_r_zps83dc0992.jpg | http://i800.photobucket.com/albums/yy287/eatmyexhaust/Cain/CogClub/edison_entry_view_r_zps83dc0992.jpg"Entry"]] \%0a%25width=230px%25 [[http://i800.photobucket.com/albums/yy287/eatmyexhaust/Cain/CogClub/Edison-Bar-eecue_29165_f8mc_l_zps9840a116.jpg | http://i800.photobucket.com/albums/yy287/eatmyexhaust/Cain/CogClub/Edison-Bar-eecue_29165_f8mc_l_zps9840a116.jpg"View"]] \%0a%25width=240px%25[[http://i800.photobucket.com/albums/yy287/eatmyexhaust/Cain/CogClub/main-bar2_zpsfb765789.jpg | http://i800.photobucket.com/albums/yy287/eatmyexhaust/Cain/CogClub/main-bar2_zpsfb765789.jpg"Main Bar"]]%0a%0a%0a%25center%25http://i800.photobucket.com/albums/yy287/eatmyexhaust/Cain/well_zps9b9975f9.png%0aThe Well is the area that is across from the bar and still part of the main common area, but is set apart as it's directly under the stairwell.  The seating is reserved, but not premium.  The seating is low slung and cozy but still gives patrons a great view of the surrounding areas.  %0a%0aIn addition, this cozy area has a small stage that usually accommodates a singer or small acoustic ensemble.  In the past it's been known to showcase local lounge singers to give that old time, prohibition era feeling to the space.%0a%0a%25center%25%25width=190px%25[[http://i800.photobucket.com/albums/yy287/eatmyexhaust/Cain/CogClub/50d4c2e90ed4dimage_zps9787c864.jpg | http://i800.photobucket.com/albums/yy287/eatmyexhaust/Cain/CogClub/50d4c2e90ed4dimage_zps9787c864.jpg"Well"]] \%0a%25width=250px%25 [[http://i800.photobucket.com/albums/yy287/eatmyexhaust/Cain/CogClub/the-well3_zps12bd6329.jpg | http://i800.photobucket.com/albums/yy287/eatmyexhaust/Cain/CogClub/the-well3_zps12bd6329.jpg"Well Too"]] %0a%0a%0a%25center%25http://i800.photobucket.com/albums/yy287/eatmyexhaust/Cain/lab_zps69d60f1d.png%0aThe Lab is the home of the second, smaller, public bar.  Though this area is the pride of the party goer.  As the main section of the Cog was once a theater this area is where the acoustics are the best and houses the largest stage (though it is still pretty small) the Cog has to offer.  On nights when there is no live music, this is the area where DJ's set up.  As of current the Cog doesn't feature any house band or DJ, but they are looking for someone to fill those roles.  Till then they offer the stage to any who are willing to fit the parts and put on an amazing show for guests.%0a%0a%25center%25%25width=200px%25[[http://i800.photobucket.com/albums/yy287/eatmyexhaust/Cain/CogClub/the-lab5_zpse2c48d13.jpg | http://i800.photobucket.com/albums/yy287/eatmyexhaust/Cain/CogClub/the-lab5_zpse2c48d13.jpg"Lab"]] \%0a%25width=200px%25 [[http://i800.photobucket.com/albums/yy287/eatmyexhaust/Cain/CogClub/the-lab4_zps2267c9d1.jpg | http://i800.photobucket.com/albums/yy287/eatmyexhaust/Cain/CogClub/the-lab4_zps2267c9d1.jpg"View"]] \%0a%25width=200px%25[[http://i800.photobucket.com/albums/yy287/eatmyexhaust/Cain/CogClub/the-lab3_zps430234ad.jpg | http://i800.photobucket.com/albums/yy287/eatmyexhaust/Cain/CogClub/the-lab3_zps430234ad.jpg"Main Bar"]]%0a%0a%0a%25center%25%25width=200px%25[[http://i800.photobucket.com/albums/yy287/eatmyexhaust/Cain/CogClub/the-lab2_zpsecd651ad.jpg | http://i800.photobucket.com/albums/yy287/eatmyexhaust/Cain/CogClub/the-lab2_zpsecd651ad.jpg"Lab"]] \%0a%25width=200px%25 [[http://i800.photobucket.com/albums/yy287/eatmyexhaust/Cain/CogClub/626432405_09221b0738_zps0a3cbed3.jpg | http://i800.photobucket.com/albums/yy287/eatmyexhaust/Cain/CogClub/626432405_09221b0738_zps0a3cbed3.jpg"View"]] %0a%0a%0a%25center%25http://i800.photobucket.com/albums/yy287/eatmyexhaust/Cain/teslalounge_zps7151d3f9.png%0aThe Tesla Lounge is an area that can be opened up to the main club or closed off for gatherings.
