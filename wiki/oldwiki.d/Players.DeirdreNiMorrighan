Her features are attractive in the Gaelic fashion, with long, flowing ebon curls framing her face and falling to the base of her shoulderblades. She is normally dressed ruggedly in denim and leather, and watches the world with intense green eyes. Her voice is smoky and low, and she has an unmistakable Irish accent - specifically from Dublin, to an educated ear.''%0a[[%3c%3c]]%0a%25%25http://wantonwicked.gamingsandbox.com/wiki/images/vtr/headers/vtr_h.png%0a''Deirdre will admit to being from Ireland and having arrived in the States in the late 1990s, and if asked will reveal her lineage as a Stormcrow and her Kindred lineage to her great-grandsire.

Any Kindred who asks will be told with no subterfuge or ceremony that she is one of the Childer of the Morrigan - a storied and  ancient line of warrior-heroes that have defended the Circle's followers since the earliest nights of the Covenant, this service literally bred into their vitae by the will of their eponymous Mother Goddess.%0a%0a'''Of Witches and Kings''': Though her first and ultimately final allegiance lies with the Circle, Deirdre is equally free to admit that outside of spiritual matters she is what Kindred of Quality refer to as being ''"Right-Thinking"'' - she has no personal interest in any politics but those of survival and the soul, but believes firmly in the First Estate's manner of governance and leadership, so long as they do not let their policies be corrupted by those of the Sanctified toward oppression of her own Covenant.%0a%0a'''A Troubling Solace''': In short, the Stormcrow is just ''entirely'' too damned content and at peace with her own Requiem for many other Kindred to be comfortable with. How can any ''sane'' being, no matter how good-natured and even motherly they may seem, consider the Requiem anything but the ''curse'' it is? What sort of twisted horror finds undeath a ''blessing''?%0a%0a[[%3c%3c]]%0a%25%25http://wantonwicked.gamingsandbox.com/wiki/images/vtr/headers/vtr_con.png%0a%0a*[[Adair]] - Regent %0a*[[Alice Stepford]] - Mothers Know Best%0a%0a%25center%25http://i152.photobucket.com/albums/s166/Packmaster_Jack/Wantion%2520Wicked/DNM_Qween_zps2ab64c4e.jpg%25%25%0a%25center%25''[-The Phantom Queen-]''%25%25%0a%0a[[%3c%3c]]%0a%25%25http://wantonwicked.gamingsandbox.com/wiki/images/vtr/headers/vtr_q.png%0a''What Others have to Say about you''%0a%0a"Beautiful, graceful, intelligent, and possessing immaculate etiquette, Madam Morrighan respects the old and rejects the new.

Any Kindred who asks will be told with no subterfuge or ceremony that she is one of the Childer of the Morrigan - a storied and  ancient line of warrior-heroes that have defended the Circle's followers since the earliest nights of the Covenant, this service literally bred into their vitae by the will of their eponymous Mother Goddess.%0a%3c %0a%3c '''Of Witches and Kings''': Though her first and ultimately final allegiance lies with the Circle, Deirdre is equally free to admit that outside of spiritual matters she is what Kindred of Quality refer to as being ''"Right-Thinking"'' - she has no personal interest in any politics but those of survival and the soul, but believes firmly in the First Estate's manner of governance and leadership, so long as they do not let their policies be corrupted by those of the Sanctified toward oppression of her own Covenant.%0a%3c %0a%3c '''A Troubling Solace''': In short, the Stormcrow is just ''entirely'' too damned content and at peace with her own Requiem for many other Kindred to be comfortable with. How can any ''sane'' being, no matter how good-natured and even motherly they may seem, consider the Requiem anything but the ''curse'' it is?
