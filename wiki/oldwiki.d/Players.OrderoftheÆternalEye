Why should we forever lose the once-forgotten knowledge and power of ages past when it's right there, waiting silently in the dark?''%0a%0a!!!Themes%0a%0aKnowledge, mystery, greed, and legacy. The ''Ordo Oculus Æternam'' seeks knowledge in all its forms and with all its power. Their devouring desire to take in everything known and unknown is taxing, and consuming in more ways than expected. What lurks in the darkness protecting the secrets so sought, and how much can the mind take of them before it begins to crack?%0a%0a!!!Summary%0a%0aThe Scribes (as they call themselves in the Order) are a group of darkly-robed and mysterious figures, primarily composed of scholars and professionals, who seek to attain every bit of knowledge and understanding they can get a hold of. This includes mundane information like the arts and sciences but also horrifyingly dark and arcane knowledge, including forbidden secrets and mystical objects. Their hunger for knowledge goes so far that they sometimes even take it from others... one way or another...%0a%0a!!!Info%0a%0aThe ''Ordo Oculus Æternam'', or "Order of the Æternal Eye," has existed for some time. Ironically, it's one of the few things they have little knowledge of. The apparent history of the Scribes seems to begin with the building of Bright Moon University, where records on worn and yellowed paper suggest they had a hand in designing the architecture, and the renovations thereafter for that matter. Ever since, they've existed as hidden scholars in the hidden substructures.%0a%0aThe Order focuses very much on the imagery of the Æternal Eye. The eye observes all, knows all, understands all. To them, the eye is the symbol of the soul's greatest ability: to observe and attain knowledge. To be one with the Æternal Eye is to be the same, knowing and seeing all. Eye imagery is maintained in most of their works, often subtle and stylized, though the particular style doesn't matter so long as it is still an eye. Many Scribes draw attention to their eyes whether it's through fashion, subtle (or extensive) makeup, tattoos, or stylized contact lenses.%0a%0aTheir intent is to acquire all knowledge in all forms and of all sorts. Primarily, their attention is geared toward hidden and/or ancient knowledge that most men dare not believe in, much less seek. They've shelves and vaults full of dusty tomes, scrolls, and weird objects in dubiously sealed containers. Conversely, they also have a stunning multimedia setup and an alarmingly large electronic library. Though modern knowledge isn't as seriously pursued beyond the sciences, anecdotal media knowledge is still catalogued, as is weather and any other events that could eventually help reveal patterns in the future. %0a%0aScribes ideally don't care where the knowledge comes from or how it was acquired, only that it's gained and could possibly have some sort of use or experiments done upon it for further knowledge. This includes genuinely useful information or objects, but also unnamed or plain-looking things with strange labels - “zombie blood” and “mermaid jerky” dot the shelves as often as indeterminately old statuettes and macabre antiques. %0a%0aThe Order respects and holds ceremonies for Scribes that die in the process of seeking knowledge, especially if others made it back with the target object. Despite a lack of acknowledgement of most people or eldritch beings killed in the course of taking knowledge, there are equally elaborate ceremonies for people whom the Scribes have “taken the crown of knowledge” from. If asked, low-level initiates are simply told to be Scribe harder until they receive the initiations to know such things.%0a%0aOn a possibly unrelated note, the Order holds reverence for death, and some of their holdings or Scribes seem benignly haunted. Indeed, some well-established Scribes even speak quietly to the air and explain when questioned that they're speaking to the dead. When asked, they answer as the others do: acquire more knowledge and wait until the initiations reveal all.%0a%0aEvery Scribe of the Order of the Æternal Eye has three things, as a member of the cult: a hood, a writing set, and a symbol of an eye. The hood is used for all formal Order events, hiding as much of the face as possible. The writing set is for all formal writing when possible, though exceptions are made when using different mediums or requiring another. The eye serves mostly as a spiritual symbol, held in times of stress and looked upon for guidance, but sometimes presented in assurance of secrecy with the words “I am that is.” All three of these objects may take different forms so long as the spirit of the symbol is maintained: a hood may be the archetypal hooded cloak or an oversized hoodie; the writing set might be a calligraphy or fountain pen set, some lovingly gnawed calligraphy brushes, or a favorite keyboard; and the eye may be that of Providence, Ra, or any other clear symbol.%0a%0a!!!Initiation:%0aThe Order of the Æternal Eye is composed mostly of scholars, students, and professionals of all sorts, but will accept nearly anyone so long as they're absolutely driven to find more knowledge and are willing to fight for it. Actual skill isn't required in doing so, merely the spirit and basic competency with such things.%0a%0aThe vast amount of knowledge maintained by Scribes in both their personal records and the greater libraries allows them to pick and choose initiates fairly easily for whatever makes them stand out, as do the sparse social networks that exist among those of similar professions and hobbies. From there, the initiate is tested. They must exhibit a desire to learn beyond simple rules and constraints and basic competency at a few mental feats. After that, the initiate is subtly indoctrinated and eventually given a number of small, anonymous puzzles of increasing difficulty that slowly clue them in to the conspiracy.%0a%0aAfter their evaluation, the initiate is abducted, black-bagged, and taken somewhere secure. They're then asked, once, if they'd like to see everything the world could ever offer. If they refuse, they're let free, but any attempts to find out who they are results in another abduction and offer that ends in death if refused a second time. If they accept, they're taken into the university's substructures, and the bag is finally removed from their head. The ritual that follows is fairly individualized based on what is known of the initiate, but always ends with an oath to the Æternal Eye, and the temporary marking of an eye upon their body in some fashion.%0a%0a!!!Areas of Influence: %0aEducation, Libraries, Museums, Records, Supernatural doohickeys.%0a%0a!!!How To Get Involved%0aThe Scribes are typically involved in education both as students and teachers, professional jobs, and those who deal in knowledge and enigmas such as scholars, writers, poets, and other inspired sorts. (Players with characters connected to the Potts, take note!) However, any character related to mystery, death, law, acquiring knowledge, or the occult may fit in as well.%0a%0a!!!Faction Initiations Bonus (Cult: Order of the Æternal Eye)%0a''(Choose one bonus from each tier.)''%0a%0a%25red%25&#9679;%25%25 Cultural Language (Order of the Æternal Eye) (&#9679;)\\%0a%25red%25&#9679;&#9679;%25%25 Contacts (Relevant to character) (&#9679;&#9679;), Library (Any) (&#9679;&#9679;), \\%0aTrained Memory (As Eidetic Memory) (&#9679;) & Whispers (&#9679;).\\%0a%25red%25&#9679;&#9679;&#9679;%25%25 Cost break on Academics & Occult  (x2), Multi-Lingual (&#9679;&#9679;),\\%0aTechnophile (&#9679;&#9679;), Area of Expertise (&#9679;&#9679;).\\%0a%25red%25&#9679;&#9679;&#9679;&#9679;%25%25 Ghost Ally (&#9679;&#9679;&#9679;), Medium (&#9679;&#9679;&#9679;), Library (&#9679;&#9679;&#9679; or +&#9679;&#9679;),\\%0aor Trained Observer (&#9679;&#9679;&#9679; or +&#9679;&#9679;).\\%0a%25red%25&#9679;&#9679;&#9679;&#9679;&#9679;%25%25 Ghost Ally (&#9679;&#9679;&#9679; or +&#9679;&#9679;), Daimon (&#9679;&#9679;&#9679;), or access\\%0ato either a special Forbidden Lore or Relic storyline.\\%0a%0ahttp://i.imgur.com/2pUql85.png%0a[[Players.JohnathanPotts|Johnathan Potts]] - He's the leader of the Order of the Æternal Eye in Savannah, and though he is much more muted in manner with his black robes on, he's still very supportive of the cause and the Scribes in their work. His powerful voice leads them through just about every ritual, and he seems a very happy zealot about the Eye. %0a%0a[[Players.PaulinaPotts|Paulina Potts]] - Her primary job in the Order is recruitment, and she does so extremely well. Her philanthropy and pushing of other social programs is legitimately for business, aid, and education, but also for collecting those bright minds into the cult! Maybe half of the initiates around are because of her work in either getting them to Bright Moon or inducting them through their work with Blackwater Publishing. Her editing is also said to be terribly important for the Order of the Æternal Eye, but there are few answers as to why.%0a%0a[[Players.HildaSmithers|Hilda Smithers]] - As a Scribe and the court liaison for the police, she collects a great amount of information from her work with the police and law. Particular knowledge of the sins of the officers before they ever reach court is not only valuable information for her to hold or use, but leads her down the path to understanding more and more about her chosen fields of knowledge.%0a%0a[[Players.s0viet|s0viet]] - Even in the Order, nobody really knows much beyond that he's thin and probably male, as he rigidly keeps his skin covered by a bandana, slitted hood, and long sleeves. In the Order of the Æternal Eye, s0viet masterminds the seeking of electronic knowledge. There are a number of Scribes who work beneath him, even professors and professionals from the IT sector despite his age, who handle most of the busywork like recovery so that he can focus on pure retrieval of information. Few databases seem safe from s0viet, but the truth of the matter is that he rarely has the motivation or drive to do more than what he likes.%0a%0a[[Players.YancyCoolidge|Yancy Coolidge]] - Similar to Paulina, his focus tends to be on recruitment, but on the personal level rather than the communal level. That is, she often gets them to the college, and he often gets them from the college to the cult. Many interesting and hungry minds are in his classes, programs, groups, or nearby them, and his access through his job makes it fairly easy to plant ideas and suggest new philosophies for potential initiates...%0a%0ahttp://i.imgur.com/lflbZv5.png%0a'''''[Note: This list only includes entries of PCs willingly placing by the players.\\%0aThere may be more hidden among you...]'''''%0a%0a[[Players.Example|Example]] - Stuff about stuff.%0a%0a!!!OOC Information%0aThe Order of the Æternal Eye is a Reason and Forbidden Lore organization.%0aCharacters that don't want to explore eldritch and doomy things may find themselves better suited to other organizations!%0a(:include CityBook.MortalNavigationBar:)

If asked, low-level initiates are simply told to be Scribe harder until they receive the initiations to know such things.%0a%3c %0a%3c On a possibly unrelated note, the Order holds reverence for death, and some of their holdings or Scribes seem benignly haunted. Indeed, some well-established Scribes even speak quietly to the air and explain when questioned that they're speaking to the dead. When asked, they answer as the others do: acquire more knowledge and wait until the initiations reveal all.%0a%3c %0a%3c Every Scribe of the Order of the Æternal Eye has three things, as a member of the cult: a hood, a writing set, and a symbol of an eye. The hood is used for all formal Order events, hiding as much of the face as possible. The writing set is for all formal writing when possible, though exceptions are made when using different mediums or requiring another. The eye serves mostly as a spiritual symbol, held in times of stress and looked upon for guidance, but sometimes presented in assurance of secrecy with the words “I am that is.” All three of these objects may take different forms so long as the spirit of the symbol is maintained: a hood may be the archetypal hooded cloak or an oversized hoodie; the writing set might be a calligraphy or fountain pen set, some lovingly gnawed calligraphy brushes, or a favorite keyboard; and the eye may be that of Providence, Ra, or any other clear symbol.%0a%3c %0a%3c !!!Initiation:%0a%3c The Order of the Æternal Eye is composed mostly of scholars, students, and professionals of all sorts, but will accept nearly anyone so long as they're absolutely driven to find more knowledge and are willing to fight for it. Actual skill isn't required in doing so, merely the spirit and basic competency with such things.%0a%3c %0a%3c The vast amount of knowledge maintained by Scribes in both their personal records and the greater libraries allows them to pick and choose initiates fairly easily for whatever makes them stand out, as do the sparse social networks that exist among those of similar professions and hobbies. From there, the initiate is tested. They must exhibit a desire to learn beyond simple rules and constraints and basic competency at a few mental feats. After that, the initiate is subtly indoctrinated and eventually given a number of small, anonymous puzzles of increasing difficulty that slowly clue them in to the conspiracy.%0a%3c %0a%3c After their evaluation, the initiate is abducted, black-bagged, and taken somewhere secure. They're then asked, once, if they'd like to see everything the world could ever offer. If they refuse, they're let free, but any attempts to find out who they are results in another abduction and offer that ends in death if refused a second time. If they accept, they're taken into the university's substructures, and the bag is finally removed from their head. The ritual that follows is fairly individualized based on what is known of the initiate, but always ends with an oath to the Æternal Eye, and the temporary marking of an eye upon their body in some fashion.%0a%3c %0a%3c !!!Areas of Influence: %0a%3c Education, Libraries, Museums, Records, Supernatural doohickeys.%0a%3c %0a%3c !!!How To Get Involved%0a%3c The Scribes are typically involved in education both as students and teachers, professional jobs, and those who deal in knowledge and enigmas such as scholars, writers, poets, and other inspired sorts. (Players with characters connected to the Potts, take note!) However, any character related to mystery, death, law, acquiring knowledge, or the occult may fit in as well.%0a%3c %0a%3c %25red%25&#9679;%25%25 Cultural Language (Order of the Æternal Eye) (&#9679;)\\%0a%3c %25red%25&#9679;&#9679;%25%25 Contacts (Relevant to character) (&#9679;&#9679;), Library (Any) (&#9679;&#9679;), Trained Memory (As Eidetic Memory) (&#9679;) & Whispers (&#9679;).\\%0a%3c %25red%25&#9679;&#9679;&#9679;%25%25 Cost break on Academics & Occult  (x2), Multi-Lingual (&#9679;&#9679;), Technophile (&#9679;&#9679;), Area of Expertise (&#9679;&#9679;).\\%0a%3c %25red%25&#9679;&#9679;&#9679;&#9679;%25%25 Ghost Ally (&#9679;&#9679;&#9679;), Medium (&#9679;&#9679;&#9679;), Library (&#9679;&#9679;&#9679; or +&#9679;&#9679;), or Trained Observer (&#9679;&#9679;&#9679; or +&#9679;&#9679;).\\%0a%3c %25red%25&#9679;&#9679;&#9679;&#9679;&#9679;%25%25 Ghost Ally (&#9679;&#9679;&#9679; or +&#9679;&#9679;), Daimon (&#9679;&#9679;&#9679;), access to either a special Forbidden Lore or Relic storyline.\\%0a%3c %0a%3c !!!NPCs%0a%3c [[Players.JohnathanPotts|Johnathan Potts]] - He's the leader of the Order of the Æternal Eye in Savannah, and though he is much more muted in manner with his black robes on, he's still very supportive of the cause and the Scribes in their work. His powerful voice leads them through just about every ritual, and he seems a very happy zealot about the Eye. %0a%3c %0a%3c [[Players.PaulinaPotts|Paulina Potts]] - Her primary job in the Order is recruitment, and she does so extremely well. Her philanthropy and pushing of other social programs is legitimately for business, aid, and education, but also for collecting those bright minds into the cult! Maybe half of the initiates around are because of her work in either getting them to Bright Moon or inducting them through their work with Blackwater Publishing. Her editing is also said to be terribly important for the Order of the Æternal Eye, but there are few answers as to why.%0a%3c %0a%3c [[Players.HildaSmithers|Hilda Smithers]] - As a Scribe and the court liaison for the police, she collects a great amount of information from her work with the police and law. Particular knowledge of the sins of the officers before they ever reach court is not only valuable information for her to hold or use, but leads her down the path to understanding more and more about her chosen fields of knowledge.%0a%3c %0a%3c [[Players.s0viet|s0viet]] - Even in the Order, nobody really knows much beyond that he's thin and probably male, as he rigidly keeps his skin covered by a bandana, slitted hood, and long sleeves. In the Order of the Æternal Eye, s0viet masterminds the seeking of electronic knowledge. There are a number of Scribes who work beneath him, even professors and professionals from the IT sector despite his age, who handle most of the busywork like recovery so that he can focus on pure retrieval of information. Few databases seem safe from s0viet, but the truth of the matter is that he rarely has the motivation or drive to do more than what he likes.%0a%3c %0a%3c [[Players.YancyCoolidge|Yancy Coolidge]] - Similar to Paulina, his focus tends to be on recruitment, but on the personal level rather than the communal level. That is, she often gets them to the college, and he often gets them from the college to the cult. Many interesting and hungry minds are in his classes, programs, groups, or nearby them, and his access through his job makes it fairly easy to plant ideas and suggest new philosophies for potential initiates...%0a%3c %0a%3c !!!!OOC Information%0a%3c The Order of the Æternal Eye is a Reason and Forbidden Lore organization.%0a%3c Characters that don't want to explore eldritch and doomy things may find themselves better suited to other organizations!%0a%3c %0a%3c (:include CityBook.MortalNavigationBar:)%0a---%0a> (:title The Order of the Æternal Eye:)%0a> %0a> (:include GameRef.WodMMaster#C-OAE#C-OAEEnd:)%0a
