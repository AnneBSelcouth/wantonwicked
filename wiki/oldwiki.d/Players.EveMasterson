If she's not on the streets, she is usually in a book store or library researching something. %0a%0a%25color=#fff%25'''''Criminals:''''' Whether she is one herself is unknown at the moment but she does have contacts with various criminal types.

Maybe you've run into her out in the swamps, near the beach, or in an abandoned building for the more urban explorers.
