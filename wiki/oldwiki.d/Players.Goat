He dresses in a rag tag assembly of torn denim and faded t-shirts. A pair of sunglasses and an untamed mane partially conceal a haggard face marred by substance abuse and animal urges. %0a%0a%25color=#9c9c9c%25A merry wanderer of the night, Goat's often seen prowling the Rack on the lookout for his next fix. Even though the Savage commonly injects his meals with various hallucinogenic drugs before quaffing he manages to move with a firm grace, a practiced strut that exaggerates his stature and posture. %0a%0a%25color=#9c9c9c%25It's only when he takes off the shades that you see the unholy mark his Gangrel blood has left. The insanity of his Beast has twisted his yellowing eyes into those of a goat. Weirdly, he doesn't just appear distorted in reflections or photographs — Goat's blurred shape becomes a horned apparition with a rack of antlers jutting out of its forehead.%0a%0a%25color=#9c9c9c%25But don't be fooled, the predatory dental hardware bleeding through his heart-eating grin is still very much designated for quick evisceration. He stalks through his Requiem like a loping animal, long strides, a strange mammalian rhythm to his gait. Goat carries himself with a kind of feral majesty that only members of Clan Gangrel can muster, with the delicate precision of a stag, the sure calm of a wolf.%0a%0a%25lfloat text-align=center margin-top=5px margin-right=15px margin-bottom=5px margin-left=0px%25http://nokturnis.net/graphics/wanton/spacer2.jpg%0a%25%25http://nokturnis.net/graphics/wanton/personalhistory.jpg%0a(:cellnr colspan=3 width=380 bgcolor=#000 align=center:)%0a%25%25http://img.photobucket.com/albums/v490/Fenris_of_Siflige/goatnewspaperreal_zps36d6bf32.jpg%0a[[%3c%3c]]%0a(:cellnr colspan=3 width=380 bgcolor=#000 align=left:)%0a%25lfloat text-align=center margin-top=5px margin-right=15px margin-bottom=5px margin-left=0px%25http://nokturnis.net/graphics/wanton/spacer3.jpg%0a%25color=#9c9c9c%25Little is know about Goat's life as a mortal, and he seems to like it that way. Originally he's from the West Coast, San Francisco to be specific, where he was picked up by a pack of marauding Gangrel who cast him into the horrors of the Danse Macabre after a particularly violent mass Embrace. The Savage brood traveled from coast to coast like modern day Huns on iron steeds, acting as messengers and outriders to the Circle. Even though Goat has only arrived in Savannah a few months ago he's already made like a swelling tick within the bowels of the Rose Dhu district, the Domain of the local [[Adair | Hierophant]]. %0a%0a%25color=#9c9c9c%25 In exchange of pledging his services as a sabbatical Wild Man to [[Adair | Adair's]] Orchard cult, he's been granted tenancy and the right to gather his own blood cult. It's widely known, at least amongst the Circle, that Goat was sent here by the decree of Grigori the Orphaner, Hierophant of New York , and his own Sire. They pushed him to leave the Chorus, pushed him to open up his blood to the world and make changes. They've thrown him to the Revenant Prince's hungry maw. But he's seemingly unfazed even though he's been exiled to the realm of a murderous spirit king. After all, the Crone teaches best through pain and tribulation.%0a%0a%25lfloat text-align=center margin-top=5px margin-right=15px margin-bottom=5px margin-left=0px%25http://img.photobucket.com/albums/v490/Fenris_of_Siflige/ef8912bd-02e7-47d9-8584-ef401624278e_zps0b10c2eb.jpg%0a%0a%25color=#9c9c9c%25 Goat says the Crone plucked the fear from his heart like a rotten fruit and devoured it. It's said he's been taken under the knife and the moon, and had his eyes rinsed with the blood of gods. He's been baptised as a Fool, a seeker of enlightenment through chaos. He's the wild card, the Wild Man, that'll topple this city into greater extremes. A finder of unsought good fortune, Goat is the last arrow in the quiver when the Circle has nothing else to lose.%0a%0a%25color=#9c9c9c%25 Sinister rumours are whispered about the Goatsucker, though. It's said that when the moon grows fat and full Goat runs wild upon the Circle's hallowed grounds, lost to the throes of Dionysian frenzy. Drug-addled and mad, stripped to his bare flesh, he performs unholy worship by slathering nubile maidens with LSD-laced blood while screaming and howling praise to dark and ancient deities. Needless to say, Goat's grooming has left his harem psychologically damaged, but they form the bedrock of a mini-cult which believes the Gangrel to be a neopagan demigod. He employs them in his blood orgy rituals, dressing them in animal skulls and little else. %0a%0a(:cellnr colspan=3 width=380 bgcolor=#000 align=right:)%0a%25%25http://nokturnis.net/graphics/wanton/storyhooks.jpg%0a(:cellnr colspan=3 width=380 bgcolor=#000 align=left:)%0a%0a%25rfloat text-align=center margin-top=5px margin-right=10px margin-bottom=5px margin-left=15px%25http://img.photobucket.com/albums/v490/Fenris_of_Siflige/goatchar2_zpsfb61bbce.jpg%0a%25lfloat text-align=center margin-top=5px margin-right=15px margin-bottom=5px margin-left=0px%25http://img.photobucket.com/albums/v490/Fenris_of_Siflige/ec0392bd-5058-4674-89f6-16f5c8390d31_zps505858d6.jpg%0a%25color=#9c9c9c%25 '''Dope Fiend (Anyone):''' %25color=#9c9c9c%25 ''Goat flits from one night to the next high on a universe of various junk that jolts him with that stark metallic shock before they make everything blend and soften the edges of reality. Even though one of the Damned he's still a party boy at heart, but it’s been tempered with experience and a real taste of just how much of a dead-end it is. Now the drug culture is a hobby, because he knows the real nightlife is somewhere else entirely. He's still got a monkey on his back though, and he's making a move from user to pusher. If you can stomach the way his blackened lenses focus on you while the devil's eyes beneath them are staring at your throat's main arteries, Goat could get you the hookup to make the party last all night long.''%0a%0a%25color=#9c9c9c%25 '''The Sabbatic Fool (Vampire, Acolytes):''' %25color=#9c9c9c%25 ''William Blake once said fools who persist in their foolishness become wise. Within the eldritch structure of the Circle Goat is a Fool, the bringer of chaos. The Fool is often valued because he stands outside the mainstream of Kindred society, gaining perspective as a pariah.  Goat's role is to enter a situation and agitate it, redirecting the course of events onto disorder, contention, disagreement and, just possibly, progress at the end of it. But Goat claims he's also a teacher of morals. If you're an Acolyte you might recognize him from the ritual ceremonies led by [[Adair]] and her cult beneath the sacred Old Oak. ''%0a%0a%25color=#9c9c9c%25 '''Son of Baphomet (Occultists, Acolytes, Dragons):''' %25color=#9c9c9c%25 ''The Goatsucker's hide is ripe with tattooed inscriptions, chtonic languages bound on the parchment of his skin. Alchemical processes are represented on Goat's arms in crude ink. The word 'Solve' has been writ across his right whereas 'Coagula' snakes up his left. He's forging himself into an avatar of raw change through the alchemy of ritual prayer to primordial pantheons, neopagan magic and communion consisting out of numerous hallucinogens. DMT, psilocybin and acid are all distilled through the Vitae, matured in the frenzied flesh of his Maenad blood dolls. After all, the road of excess leads to the palace of wisdom. Maybe you walk a similarily esoteric path?''%0a%0a%25color=#9c9c9c%25 '''Strange Bedfellows (Vampire):''' %25color=#9c9c9c%25 ''Goat's been seen stalking at the side of the scrawny,  discarnate [[Frankie Burstrom]], rubbing elbows with the debutante freakshow of the First Estate [[Ashildr de Haviland]] and vying for dominance with her feral valet [[Tracy Delaney]]. Even [[Gideon Ward]] has been sighted with the Savage bastard. Gathering on desolate and moonlit streets and prowling amongst the Damned of Savannah they have come together over the last month like a congregation of hungry alligators out on the bayou. It's rumoured they hold parliament in the haunted and forsaken halls of House Haviland.
