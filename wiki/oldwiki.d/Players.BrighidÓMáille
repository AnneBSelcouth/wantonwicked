diff:1382239049:1382236747:=34,42c34%0a%3c ''The twins were identical in life and are still identical in undeath.  They seem to be in their young twenties, although vampires would know better.  Their hair is a fiery red, an indication of their Irish roots and is also one of the few things that differentiates the twins - Brighid with her straightened hair and Morrigan with her more wild hair.  (Not always an accurate differentiation however.)  The two exude an air of tranquility, confidence, and synergy even when not together.   Their sense of style ranges from gothic to sensual to grunge and the two almost always seem very well dressed for the occasion.  Unlike many kindred these two seem to still have the lingering vestiges of life within them; the subtle movements that a living creature would have.  Gracing their fair skin on their left forearms is a tattoo of their coat of arms however this is almost always covered.%0a%3c %0a%3c ''Outfits'':  The twins wear a variety of outfits but have a distinct style.  They both wear high laced calf height [[https://www.kawaiiwolf.com/img/vampboots.jpg|boots]] in almost every occasion.  They tend to prefer jeans (torn but not bought that way), a t-shirt, and a [[https://www.kawaiiwolf.com/img/vampjacket.jpg|leather jacket]] as well.  They can also be seen in various cocktail dresses in a multitude of styles and colors when out clubbing, but still they wear their favorite boots.  %0a%3c %0a%3c ''Armaments'':%0a%3c Brighid:  She openly carries a side arm strapped to her hip or just inside her jacket depending on the location or weather.  The weapon is a brushed [[http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/d/d8/Pistole_SIG_Sauer_P226_S.jpg|steel handgun]] with a black grip and trim.  At least this is the weapon she usually has with her.  %0a%3c %0a%3c ''Bike'':%0a%3c The twins own an electric [[https://www.kawaiiwolf.com/img/vampbike.jpg|motorcycle]] called a lightning.  It’s sleek, black silver and red, and ultra quiet compared to it’s gas powered cousins but it doesn’t lack the raw power that one would associate with electric vehicles.  The two can be seen speeding through the historical district or all over town obscured by their [[https://www.kawaiiwolf.com/img/vamphelmet.jpg|helmets]], seemingly unaware of the of the speed limit.''%0a---%0a> ''Place your Description Here''%0a45,49c37%0a%3c ''* '''Public''' - The twins are well known in the [[Historical District]] of Savannah especially in the nightclub scene.  Outside of that they are mysterious socialites that live well and seem to not have a normal job or source of income.  Guys and some girls from the local clubs speak of the triumph of bagging this mysterious duo and nights of unimagined ecstasy.  These are just rumors though.  They’re known to pick fights with random people or anyone that dares threaten one of them.%0a%3c %0a%3c * '''Vampire''' - The twins can often be found hunting the [[Historical District]], on the prowl for poachers or enjoying the status their immortality grants them. As Daeva, the herd flocks to them. They’re known to be saucy and brazen, but not without mercy; even the worst of our kind is not beyond redemption.%0a%3c %0a%3c * '''Order of the Dragon''' - The twins are the rising stars of the order, [[Esteban Cypriano|Esteban]]’s pet project gone right. They’ve quickly gained the ranks, embraced the coils and swore the Oath of the Axe. Most of their efforts benefit the Order or further their own understanding of the curse of vampirism (and how to tame it) even if their approach is far from scholarly. They are entrusted with dangerous assignments and have hunted down one traitor to the Order not too far back. They’re oddly never found working separately, despite orders to the contrary from elders; some suspect the Grand Wyrm is playing favorites.''%0a---%0a> ''Place your Public History Here''%0a52,60c40%0a%3c ''* '''Business & Pleasure''' - The twins can often be found at nightclubs or bars late at night. All they need to do is mind their own business and let dinner come to them.%0a%3c %0a%3c * (''Vampire'') '''Guard Dogs''' - The twins are often on the prowl in the [[Historical District]] for poachers not respecting the sovereignty of [[Esteban Cypriano]]’s hunting grounds. %0a%3c %0a%3c * (''Vampire'') '''Sworn of the Axe''' - The twins are quite adept in the art of “getting things done.” For a price they don’t seem to mind doing dirty work, so long as it doesn’t conflict with their interests or those of the Order of the Dragon. %0a%3c %0a%3c * (''Ordo Dracul'') '''An outside perspective''' - The twins are looking for a “little sister” to join their coterie. An outside perspective and someone to potentially mentor would prove valuable, especially given the dangerous nature of their assignments. For a slave an opportunity like this is hard to pass on (Ordo Dracul, Female, Covenant Status between 0 and 2).%0a%3c %0a%3c * '''Bitches Love Cannons''' - Brighid is both fascinated with firearms and loves to learn more.  She has a few rare weapons and is happy to get more.  She’s also looking for a particular long range rifle.
