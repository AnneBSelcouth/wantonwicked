She stands with a slight build and a smile that seems to draw in the room, that unidentifiable something that marks her as unopposing as can be. Her hair she seems to wear in a constant state of flux, sometimes in tails or braids, sometimes left free to be swept around her shoulders. This season she seems to be enjoying ribbons. There's a bounce to her step and even her eyes seem to smile, a genuine curiousity even if it doesn't befit the mood. She stands a couple inches over five feet, more depending on the heel for that day and even in this time of year she's want for sandals and skirts. Her sense of fashion is timeless yet keen though perhaps slightly eclectic in it's color. Her eyes are a most vibrant green, although they might just be contact lenses.%0a%0a&#8195;Those who might see beyond the fairy mask to see the mein that rests beneath catch a %0a(:cellnr width=400 colspan=2 align=center:)https://www.kawaiiwolf.com/img/pair.jpg%0a(:tableend:)%0aglimpse at the truth of her ephemeral soul. The smile is always there, although the cunning might suppose even her true face carries that mask. As to the rest of her, it's hard to place a fix; she's long luxurious fur, a beastly seeming would be no mistake, mammalian at that, but she's never quite how you remember her. Her nose a little thinner, her eyes .. were they always that color ?  Her rich silky fur, maybe it changes with the seasons for it wasn't so long and lavender white last summer. %0a%0a&#8195;One thing though, that you could never miss was the way she seems to glow. No no, it's not the smile, her fur and skin seems almost radiant; for those lucky enough to be caught in the dark you'd swear it's almost literally so; she's a bright little torch to stand aside her shadowy skinned lover.%0a%0a&#8195;Those lucky enough to have seen her courtly garb, a Hedgespun Raiment of obvious spring theme, they could describe it thus (pictured below on her Mask):%0a%0a->''A pink nightgown crafted of tulip and magnolia petals, sewn with the silk of butterfly cocoons. The gown is accented with the pure white fur of a snowy rabbit and the lace, ribbons that decorate it's length, and the silk made into her sheer black stockings are spun from the whispered words, fragments of love letters, and the last breaths of a dying poet.
